<p>As we wrapped up the course, students took time to reflect on their time in Hawaii. Here are their thoughts.</p>



<h2>Liliana</h2>



<p>The experiences of this trip both confirmed and strengthened previous interests as well as introduced exciting new ones. It gave me new lenses through which to view the world, some from a creation standpoint and some to take forward hopefully far into the future. This trip was so culturally rich, a topic which I find fascinating, and the lack of language barrier made it far more accessible. I truly felt that I could just soak the culture in, like a sponge with water. Culture exists in Hawai՝i not just in native Hawaiian traditions, but in the communities of children growing up there, as well as many people who have only just recently found their residence there. (All of the people we spoke to, at least, I’m sure there are some of the more ‘touristy’ types as well.) One aspect of the culture that really stood out to me is the deep connection with place that so many people have. It is not something that you can find as much here. Sure, there are many people very grateful to the land, people appreciate the space they live. Gardeners and farmers and park rangers all have a connection to the land, but there is something different about the quality of connection. There is an additional level of respect for the land, history, and people that make a place: home.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Joshua</h2>



<p>Over my time in Hawaii, the most impactful thing that I had learned about and experienced was how centered around self-reflection the Hawaiian culture seemed to be. Everything that we learned about, from kuleana to the kilo observation techniques, seemed to have profound importance on knowing yourself and then using that to make a difference. The kuleana, from what we had heard and seen, was intended as a sense of responsibility; most people we had talked to had genuinely believed that it was their responsibility to pick up trash on the beach, replant native trees, or something else along that line. The most important one we had learned of over the trip was the Oli when we were tasked with declaring our intentions for being in a place to make sure that we were making the most out of the experience we were given. Beyond that, most of these people also felt that it was their responsibility to teach us. Once we are able, it will become our responsibility to teach the next generation to continue the cycle of caring for the land that we live on and protecting native agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Elijah</h2>



<p>This course has been a constant reminder of the strength of the individual.</p>



<p>Western culture, the U.S. especially, demonstrates that in every facet of life. A great example: Star Wars. Every clone soldier looks and behaves exactly the same; a single faceless enemy. Meanwhile, every protagonist is different and “special”. We are taught that we should also be different and special.</p>



<p>For the longest time, I figured the main benefit of this tendency was a kind of culture biodiversity. If everyone tries to be different and unique, it becomes a lot easier to find solutions that haven’t been explored before.</p>



<p>While all that may still be true, I now see it in a different light. Western culture was not just teaching us how to be, it was teaching us what to be: an individual person that has the power to make change. Western society is built by individuals, each working towards the betterment of their lives, and the lives of their community.</p>



<p>The individual’s story is also one of specialization.</p>



<p>Each individual does not need to effect change in all areas of their lives, they need to effect change by using one specific skill. A plumber, for example, can fix a broken sink in less than half the time an electrician can. That gives the electrician more time. A skilled engineer can pick up more plastic in the ocean, or carbon dioxide out of the air than a cook can in the same time. A lot more. But neither is necessarily more important to society. The engineer saves time by buying their food from the cook’s restaurant. The cook, by proxy, has picked up a substantial amount more plastic than they would have otherwise.</p>



<p>Specialists are better and faster at their jobs. In an ideal world, there would be a person for each necessary skill or task. It would be efficient.</p>



<p>I am going to spend my time enhancing my main skills, and be a part of the grand experiment.</p>

<h2>Jenna</h2>



<p>The trip to Hawaii can’t be put into one word, or even one sentence. I learned so much about Hawaii as a place, and culture. I realized that though Hawaii is a state in the US, it seems like a completely different place. From the kindness and love that people have, to speaking pigeon (a mix of Hawaiian and English), it feels like a different country. Something especially different is all the unique food, we tried so many different foods that are only in Hawaii. People use food to show their love and appreciation, they also talk about it, show you how to make it or where to get it. I loved bonding with other high schoolers, adults, and my classmates through our shared experiences. Other than my newfound knowledge of Hawaii, and my recognition that there is still so much to learn, I had a big takeaway from this trip in particular. A trend on watershed trips is that I notice a way I can improve. In past trips it has mostly been mental change, outwardly shown by my confidence, or small fixes in how I think and carry myself. During this trip I realized that along with the mental growth I have obtained, I want to change something bigger. We spoke to Sustainable Coastline, a nonprofit organization, about how people fall into a hopeless mindset regarding climate change. I acknowledge that I have had the ‘were practically doomed’ mindset for a whyle, but I found hope talking to them. Even small actions I take by changing what I buy and eat can make a tiny difference, and I want to make that change in my life, as well as bring hope to people around me. Overall Hawaii was an amazing experience full of bonding, learning, and realizations. </p>

<h2>Carson</h2>



<p>May term has been absolutely incredible. There aren’t many other words that can describe it. Not many people have the opportunity to spend both spend two weeks in Hawaii, but also to spend that time intuitively learning about ecology, evolution, and history with real experts on each subject. The places we were able to explore, the people we met, and the unexpected bonds we developed with each other were all experiences that I will never be able to forget. The places I have had the privilege to go with Watershed have each been nothing short of the best experiences of my life, and this one has been absolutely no exception.</p>



<p>Alongside our trip and the experiences developed, this trip was able to give me much needed reflection time for myself. Gone were the stresses of everyday life back in Colorado, and here in Hawaii I could think about my family, friends, my future all with a clearer mind. The downtime we had has helped me shape who I truly am. The social experiences helped me realize my limits, the academic experiences helped me realize my capabilities, and I have helped me determine who I may truly be. Had this trip not happened, this self reflection wouldn’t have been possible, and I don’t know where I would be.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2>Zac</h2>



<p>Our experience in Hawaii was, to say the least, transformative. The typical Hawaii experience of a white tourist from the continental United States is filled with entertainment and attractions, giving a sub-level spiritual experience. Tourists have never heard of Kuliana. Tourists have never heard of Aloha Aina. Tourists have never heard of the history of colonization. Tourists have never heard of Kilo. Our group has experienced Kuliana. Our group has experienced Aloha Aina. Our group has experienced the effects of colonization. Our group has experienced Kilo. Basking in the rich cultural history and the ecology of the place we are guests in changes the viewer&#8217;s experience so much. In a way, it binds you to the surrounding environment, making you one with your experience. Not only did we learn or hear about these things, we constantly practiced them over the course. Those 15 days have been exponentially impactful on each and every one of us, but I can only write for myself. I have been greatly impacted. Giving back to the environment and participating in a foreign culture changed my outlook on my own world. I find myself reaching into my home environment, being more observant of the surroundings, and being attentive to the waste I produce and the impact I have. Summed up, my Hawaii experience was, to say the least, unitive with my environment.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2>Asher</h2>



<p>Hawaii was an amazing time, and I thoroughly miss it. From our experience there I realized a few things. First being there is a huge movement there to recapture, preserve, and maintain culture. Second, there is a huge movement for recreation of old Hawaii in terms of ecology, and plantlife. Finally, there are major movements to make Hawaii as close to old Hawaii as possible, which is pretty much the ultimate goal of the previous two. Of the people I asked in Hawaii what their eventual goal was, Malia&#8217;s answer stood out. She said her goal overall was to restore KawaiNui marsh back to what it was before, a full fish pond that people could go to, farm along the edges of, fish in, and recreate in. From her answer I wondered if that was the goal for the entire island, and due to some of the other things we did it seemed that was the goal. Of course Hawaii can not be made back into what it was before, because of the fact that so many of its native species have died, but the goal is to get it as close as possible in this new world. I’m curious to see what happens in Hawaii over the course of my lifetime. I hope the people we interacted with achieve their goal but I hope it stays a nice vacation spot for many people.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Raina</h2>



<p>I went into this trip with an incredible love for science and biology. I left with an even deeper meaning of why the work scientists do is important. In Hawai’i, we spent countless hours doing service work, research, and learning the history of the place we were staying. From my time in Hawai’i, I discovered a deeper meaning of the relevance that science has. Beside the fact that it’s essential for developing a more sustainable future, I also realized how important it is for cultures. Creating and recreating thriving bioculture can bring together communities and people from all different backgrounds. I noticed this when we went to one of the farms in Hawai’i. They were growing Kalo, as well as the community around them. Having a goal set in science and bettering the planet and finding people around you with the same beliefs and goals can create such a better outcome than solely doing science for science. My time in Hawai’i made it even clearer to me that science is what I want to do with my life. I want to be able to help the planet and help people around me.</p>

<p>Waking up at 7:30, we made ourselves a delicious breakfast of eggs and pancakes. We all gathered around the dining room table for the last formal group meal. After we were all finished eating, we began to pack up the Vrbo; we packed out everything and two people ran to the store to get Becky and Keira some fun gifts for their remaining time on the island. After we were all packed up we went to Waikiki. Liliana and Julie delivered the gift bag to Becky and Keira and we all went to sit in the grass by the lagoon to have some group discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group sat in a circle, the lagoon water peaceful, hotels and tourist destinations towering above us. The ocean waves were a distant noise beside us, and pigeons scoured the grass for food scraps. To begin our discussion about the Bishop Museum, we reflected on our experiences in the two main exhibits: the Science Hall and the Hawaiian Hall. Beginning with the Science Hall, we found that the group had made a lot of connections from our previous learnings here. The museum had exhibits that talked about the role of volcanoes in creating the Hawaiian islands. These exhibits also explained the different types of igneous rocks that form based on the rate at which the lava cools, which determines the size of the crystals in the rocks. We spent time covering this before we left Colorado by watching various videos and hearing from a professor at Colorado School of Mines. There were also many exhibits on invasive plants and animals in Hawaii, information we have learned a lot about. There was a table with sand from different parts of Hawaii and information from what the sand was made of. There was one type of sand on the table called skeleton sand that is made from broken up shells and coral. This is the same type of sand we used as a buffer when we were doing a lab on ocean acidification. Next we went over things we learned. We learned more information on shield volcanoes, like how they form from thicker, cooler lava. Volcano glass is seen as different parts of Pele (the volcano goddess); glass droplets are Pele’s tears, formed from drops of lava cooling quickly in water; thin glass strands, formed from pieces of rock pulling apart the lava as it cools is Pele&#8217;s hair; and Limo-o-Pele (Pele seaweed) is bubbling lava and glass shards quickly cooling in water creating a seaweed looking glass. Then we went over questions that came up such as, ”is it hard to tell whether or not a fish species is native to Hawaii?” and, ”how do underwater landslides form?”</p>



<p>Afterwards, we transitioned to talking about the Hawaiian Hall. This part of the museum was detailed and included extensive information on many different aspects of Hawaii. There was so much information we could have all spent all day in the Hawaiian Hall. The Hall was divided into three categories-above, below and outward-the same three that the Hawaiian world is separated into. The top level was ‘above’ or the heavens where there was information on important people in Hawaii’s history. The middle level was ‘outward’ or the horizon and beyond, where there was a lot of information on culture. And the bottom level was ’below’ or the depth of the sea, where there was information on boats, fishing, and the significance of the ocean. The group went around and said some connections we made to previous learnings we have had throughout the trip. There was a lot of information on outrigger canoes; exhibits on the different types, how they are made, what they were used for and much more. It was fun to learn more about the canoes after getting to paddle in one. There was a lot of information on kapa cloth, a fabric made from the bark of a wauke or paper mulberry plant. The cloth is made from pounding the wet bark to thin it; when it is the desired length it is painted on and can be used for almost anything, such as clothing, shoes, blankets, decorations, and packaging. We met a woman making this on our hike in Waimea Valley. There were also lots of things that we could connect to the different books we were reading, like all of the information on Moloka’i and the leprosy outbreak in Hawaii. Next we talked about what we learned. We all found different aspects interesting and took time to immerse ourselves in them. There was a whole section devoted to tattoos, or tatau. The walls were lined with pictures of beautiful and intricate tattoos. Samoan tattoos are one of the world&#8217;s most distinctive tattoo trends, and have been essential in the preservation of the Samoan culture. Being a tofuga (master tattoo artist) was a high social status. Tattoos were tied to coming of age and the government, and getting one was part of a big ritual. One part of the museum I found interesting was the part talking about medicine. Hawaiian medicine was applied 5 times because the body has 5 members: the head, chest, stomach, hips and legs. The moon phases were also super important to the Hawaiin culture. The different phases told people when planting, fishing and weather would be good. We all went around to talk about our questions that we had during our exploration through the Hawaiian Hall. There were a lot of questions about the gods: what determines a god&#8217;s gender? How many are there? What are all the gods&#8217; powers? Overall we all loved the Hawaiian Hall and walked away with a lot of new, interesting information to keep our minds occupied.</p>



<p>We transitioned our discussion towards our assigned reading. The final project of the class will be a paper, connecting the aforementioned reading to the trip, as well as the few days of class prior. The precise goal of this “Book Talk&#8221;—as it came to be known—was to define a specific question for this paper to answer.&nbsp; While each question was specific to each person, there was an overarching theme.</p>



<p>People wanted to bring everything together. All the learning experiences, facts, and understandings wanted to coalesce into a single question. A single understanding constructed from the connections between these things.</p>



<p>After the exhaustive discussions concluded, we all looked towards the hotels of Honolulu. Massive pillars of cement and marble, they encircled the tourist epicenter of Hawaii: Waikiki. Brushing off the lethargy that usually results from extended discussions, the group fractured into smaller pods and set out to the Waikiki shopping district. As Chelsea made clear earlier that morning, the intent was to see what many envision when they hear the word “Hawaii”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last two weeks, we experienced a diverse set of people, places, plants, and animals that now make up our vision of Oahu. As primarily a tourist destination, most people who visit the Hawaiian Islands don’t understand how scarce native plant life is. Nor do they see the native Hawaiian people’s unique, ongoing effort to maintain and replenish their culture. Many tourists never leave Honolulu, let alone work and camp on a community farm. We had a chance to see Hawaii as it truly is: a home.</p>



<p>It is easy to look down upon the tourist industry with pity or scorn. It is true that most tourists don’t experience what life in Hawaii really is, but that is also not their goal. They want a chance to relax, perhaps even reflect on life. To say that these vacationers do not give back would be pretentious. The island’s entire economy rests on its primary export: tourism. Even in the breadth and depth of this trip, we did not learn much about the relationship between the Hawaiian people and the Hawaiian corporation. It is dangerous to put judgment on that which we don’t understand.</p>



<p>This afternoon in Waikiki was a glimpse into that unknown. In this writer’s opinion, it was pretty underwhelming. The Waikiki strip felt like every other mall in America. That may be intentional. The industry might just be responding to their consumers desire to feel comfortable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reunited the pods in the same place they fractured: the Hilton Hotel beach side lawn, where we were greeted by Chelsea&#8217;s former student, Logan Shiroma. The exchange was brief, giving an overview of each other’s lives. She gifted us some candy.</p>



<p>Walking to the van, the group waved one last farewell to those quarantined. Then we unceremoniously climbed inside and drove the short distance to the airport. After silently thanking the island and its inhabitants for their hospitality, we boarded a plane and flew home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Initially, our plan for the day was to go to the Paepae o He&#8217;eia fish pond to do some work restoring it to its natural setting. Instead, due to yesterday&#8217;s COVID events, we did Monday&#8217;s plan; the Bishop Museum.<br><br>We woke up at 7:30 in the morning to Ari and Zac playing an intense chess match, and cereal waiting for us. After we had our breakfast and got dressed for the day (with a packing list created by Chelsea) we left at around 8:45 to head to the Bishop Museum. Upon arrival, we immediately noticed the beauty of the campus. It looked like an Ivy League college campus, with evenly spread out vegetation and perfectly green grass covering every possible inch. </p>



<p>Our goal for our visit was to go to the Hawaiian hall and the Science Adventure Center. Both of which are absolutely massive and absolutely filled with information. The science hall being filled with tons of information on the formation of the Hawaiian islands and volcanic flows, and the Hawaiian hall being filled with cultural history. After going through both of the sections of the museum we went to see a planetarium show on the Wayfinder, a ship that sailed between many Pacific island chains, including Hawaii and Tahiti. Upon finishing the short movie, the planetarium staff member did a small presentation for us on how to navigate the ocean using only the sun, stars, and our hands. Obviously, there was a ton of information that we would be missing, as it takes years for someone to even be able to start navigating.</p>



<p>After we finished our visit to the museum, we readily headed into the van for our 15 minute ride to the beach. With the temperature being in the low eighties, it was both sad and amazing for us to get into the water. Sad, because it was our final ocean time, and amazing because of how great it felt. We had an amazing final beach hour, small calm waves, no current, a nearby coral reef and warm waters. Many of us swam over to the reef, which was just a foot or two below the surface of the water, and we spent most of our time over there, splashing each other and diving. About halfway through, a few people swam to the shore to either chill out, or dig holes (a previously mentioned favorite pastime of our beach visits).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once we finished our time in the sand, we took about 10 minutes to do a quick get-the-saltwater-off beach shower and make a change of clothes. From there we traveled to the Vrbo, where we split off into groups, some people reading their choice books and some people cleaning out the group van. We also did our full shower rotation. At around 5:30, we transitioned into blog work and preparing for dinner. We watched the Disney ‘film’ <em>Moana </em>to finish our final full day in Hawaii, all of us excited to finally head home.</p>



<p>With this being our final full day in Hawaii, we feel like we did a lot of the highlights. We learned about Hawaiian culture and history at the Bishop Museum, and we spent time in the water and the sand, with the sun beating down on us. We can’t wait to be back, either together or separately in the future!</p>



<p>One realization we had at the Bishop Museum was that where we were, the island of O’ahu, developed much the same as other islands (culturally, at least, and until the arrival of the rest of the world’s peoples.) This was inspired by a boating evolution exhibit, which showed one of the original (potentially Tahitian) double-hulled canoes used to travel around the Polynesian Triangle of ye olde Pacific. But while cultures branched throughout time and throughout the islands, the double-hull design and purpose remained the same, save for a few widenings, narrowings, and visually evident fabrication techniques.</p>



<p>Beyond the efforts the Polynesians made into making their vessels was their efforts they made into making a reliable system for navigating the ocean. And we’re glad they did&#8211; if the rest of the world got to Hawai’i first, there would be no ancient history to study (or, in other words, not quite enough to make a course out of).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This story really starts at about 9:30 last night, with Chelsea, Becky, and Keira taking some home Covid tests. Keira had mentioned a sore throat earlier that evening, so she and Becky decided to test out of an abundance of caution. Before she had gotten halfway back to the tents, Becky caught up to her and gently broke the news She has Covid. Definitely not the news anyone wants to hear, especially with fun events and a long flight scheduled for the next few days. As bummed out and concerned as she was, Keira was ready to go with the flow and stay positive about the situation. She was also proud to have made it this long, as this is the first time she’s gotten Covid! Plus, this was way better than getting sick right at the beginning of the trip. Upon arrival back to the kitchen, Becky got a similar taste of information. Chelsea read the positive result out to her, too. At least they weren’t alone, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liliana was summoned next, as they’ve been Keira’s tent mate for the duration of the trip, and the group would need to know how sleeping arrangements would be shifted around. With their test coming out negative, the decision was made to also test Jenna and Raina. Raina’s came back with a faint line indicating a positive result, so we decided to separate the four of us for the night. We would wait until morning to break the news and test everyone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a morning of solemnly moping around, everyone in KN95 masks, coping in their own ways, Keira, Raina, and Becky were on their way to the airport to take a rapid PCR test. Chelsea and Becky had spent too much time trying to find a testing site, and the closest with a rapid result was the airport. The drive was sad, quiet, and extremely long. We spent 20 minutes driving around the airport to find the right parking place, and after not being able to, we decided to park as close as possible (which was unnecessarily far away) and walk. After finally getting there, we struggled to properly register for the tests. Keira and Raina sat on the curb while Becky sorted things out. Eventually, we were able to get through our tests and make the trek back to the car.</p>



<p>Finally free from airport purgatory, we set off in search of a belated lunch. Google Maps led us to a nonexistent Wendy’s, so with growling stomachs and a static-heavy radio, we roamed the streets in search of another option. As if by a miracle, Keira spotted a Panda Express out of the corner of her eye and we circled the block to approach the drive-thru. We had no idea Panda Express even had drive-thrus!</p>



<p>Food acquired at last, we returned to one of our first beaches for a socially-distanced picnic. Once we finished eating, we were able to talk to our parents on the phone, which was fun despite the circumstances! As we waited for the AirBnB to be ready, Raina worked intently on another friendship bracelet and Keira dug a sandcastle barricade to protect her seat from the rising tide. We spent some nice time walking with our feet in the water as well.</p>



<p>After our journey to the beach, we headed to the AirBnB to settle in. We met up with Julie, as she flew in after a call saying that Chelsea needed extra assistance since Becky would be out. She took the car and headed to the Vrbo to meet up with the rest of the group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rest time was still not quite upon us as we fought with the technology in the AirBnB with the last remaining braincell we shared. The instacart order for dinner wouldn’t be arriving in time, so we decided to order pizza. The online system was malfunctioning and the store hung up on Becky three times. All while she was dealing with this, Keira was trying to get the smart tv/Blu-ray box to work. After switching batteries between remotes, unplugging things, and eventually stealing the (superior) monitor from Becky’s bedroom, it was up and running. Connecting to the Wi-Fi went smoothly, but then Raina and Keira both proceeded to forget their Netflix passwords for the next ten minutes. We were too tired for a movie anyway.</p>



<p>Once we finally got our pizza, (we landed on each of us getting our own small individual ones) Becky unexpectedly headed outside onto the balcony. We had been awaiting the call all day to determine our test results. When Becky came inside, she looked at Raina with her pizza box in her hand and said, “Don’t eat that in here.” Raina, confused, said “umm, why not?” as to which Becky responded with “Because you’re not staying here.” After a couple seconds of watching the gears turning in Raina’s head, she finally shouted out and starting jumping up and down, when Becky and Keira also joined her in the chaotic craziness of the feeling Raina had of being able to go home. Keira and Becky’s tests came back positive unfortunately, but they couldn’t help but feel happy for Raina. We all split ways and sat on different balconies to enjoy our pizza while we awaited Julie to come pick Raina up to join the rest of the group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Raina was off to reunite with everyone else, Becky and Keira settled in further for the night. It was very quiet without the rest of the group, but it was also nice to have some peace and privacy, not to mention the incredible ocean view. Keira slept for fourteen hours, but Becky was back up with the sunrise for her teacherly duties. Thanks Becky!</p>



<p>We spent the rest of our time in Waikiki working, relaxing, talking to the many birds that visited our balcony, and enjoying a wave goodbye to the rest of the group before they flew out. Thanks to the goodies they brought us, as well as the ridiculous amount of snacks Becky’s aunt Deborah dropped off, we were very well fed and felt loved! We painted our nails multiple times, had a mini spa day, watched all of <em>Good Omens</em>, completed a jigsaw puzzle, and eventually got to go swimming in the ocean one last time before beginning the long flight back home.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are two sides to today’s story. One side: we got to sleep in past the planned wake-up call at 6:30. Subsequent the day of outrigger canoeing, we were dead tired, and so the extra sleep was appreciated. The other side of the story: some members of our group contracted the dreaded SARS-CoV-2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How exciting.</p>



<p>The original plan for the day involved a visit to the Bishop Museum. As Chelsea relayed the news of the virus’ invasion, one could feel the apprehension and uncertainty ripple through the group. As the new plan was being worked out, everyone became beautifully adorned with the (sadly familiar) KN95 masks. From then on, every action had to be executed with utmost care, for if one became infected, they would be trapped for 5 days in a hotel room, thousands of miles away from home, dead center of the Pacific Ocean. After breakfast had been consumed, as well as a short wait for the rain to stop, the group scattered about. Some read their books, some wandered into the woods to abuse bamboo, and some played solo chess (which, for reference, Joshua lost).</p>



<p>After refreshing with some Shave Ice from a place called Waiola, we began our journey to our Vrbo stationed in Kaimuki, Honolulu. At this point, the energy of the group settled as we began to reflect on the situation, the missed opportunities, our lost group members, and what would happen next. Our mental reflections would be cut off short though, as we arrived at the Vrbo and had trouble parking for 5 solid minutes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://elijahpotter.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-257" srcset="https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-2000x1500.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The uninfected crew enjoying a beautiful view on the drive to the Airbnb.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It is worth noting that Hawaii is not unique with the wonderful treat Shave Ice (though that does not invalidate its goodness). For example, Bao Bing, sold in China, is practically the same thing. It was first introduced to Hawaii by Japanese immigrants in the mid-1800s as <em>kakigori</em>. Skipping over a century, we arrive in the mid-1900s, when some Hawaiian families opened up general stores and began selling the product, calling it shave ice (though at some places on Hawaii the island, it is called ice shave). One such example of a general store is Matsumoto’s, opened in 1951, which does business to this very day (and, if I may add, quite successfully; they easily reach 1,000 sales of shave ice alone on an average weekend Honolulu day.)</p>



<p>Wearily, we entered the Vrbo, astonished by the quality of the place. While not the view we got to experience from the top of the penthouse on days 1 and 2, we had an unparalleled living experience, actual showers, and had enough beds for everyone (with Joshua graciously taking a large closet).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Informing Watershed was one of the first things Becky and Chelsea did after learning of the COVID cases. The direct result: Julie Yates immediately hopped on a plane and began the seven hour flight from Denver to Honolulu. Shortly after the group arrived at our Vrbo rental, Julie landed and drove the distance to join us. Greeted with smiling faces hidden behind masks, some of us could finally feel much of the remaining apprehension and anxiety vanishing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As our trip to the Bishop museum was postponed and our plans had vanished, we decided to watch Despicable Me, absolutely demolish a bag of Chex Mix, work on this very blog, and generally reflect on the terrible day.</p>



<p>Still drenched with sadness (and some of us with rain,) over our now lost group members, we absolutely inhaled chicken fajitas. But at least something went right, because our sorrow was somewhat cut short when Chelsea announced that while Raina tested positive when she had done the rapid test while back at camp, she had taken a PCR test at the hotel and came back negative. We were rejuvenated, finally having gotten good news.</p>



<p>After we finished dinner, we started to set up our beds for the coming night. Our preparations, like many other things, had been cut short; Raina had finally arrived. We cheered, and some greeted with open arm hugs (whether we should’ve been hugging after having such an intense COVID scare is up to debate). At this point, we had our traditional circle, and could finally get to bed.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Heyo. Ari here. Today was —with more certainty than I thought possible— a true test of character. As Chelsea so succinctly put it: “It’s strange seeing so many people processing the same thing together in the same place.” And so, in our individual processing, we all went separate ways; some crying, some sitting solemnly in the rain, some laughing in order to forget. And then there was me, rampaging in the forest by beating down trees with a sturdy bamboo stick. I thought I had learned, over these past couple of years, to control my emotions. Turns out they were learning too. They won me over, and taught me a lesson in the process. They taught me that no matter how much I try not to be, I am human. They taught me that I can scream and cry and smile and die and that that’s all okay. That I am alive, and that that’s the reason I can feel. That I, in all, am human. And I, in all, am proud.</p>



<p>If that’s not a Watershed moment, I don’t know what is.</p>



<p>Thanks, COVID.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>In the months prior to our departure to Hawai’i, that funny feeling had started to fade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That funny feeling that the world was out of control. Permanently unstable. Permanently uncertain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That funny feeling that the temporal landmarks our parents previously defended as sacred, were no&nbsp; longer as important. Prom, graduation, parties.</p>



<p>That funny feeling that we had no say. Not even the leaders of the most powerful institutions seemed to be able to quell the storm.</p>



<p>That funny feeling that people had begun to go missing. Lost to history among a crowd of millions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If heaven exists, the immigration office must be freaking out.</p>



<p>Today, that funny feeling returned. Not just for one person; for all of us. Chelsea&#8217;s line on collective processing reminded us of that. The pandemic has been terrible on every scale, but it has done something not many things have: created common ground.</p>



<p>Of the hours of stories and droplets of wisdom Mark conveyed to us during our stay on Coconut Island, one nuggets stands out. He told us to stop anthropomorphizing things. Calling a pufferfish cute is fun, but it blinds you to its true nature: a poisonous predator that can kill you if you venture too close.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark had a point. But I think there is utility in anthropomorphic projection. For the duration of the pandemic, humanity had a common enemy. Every individual worked to defeat it. Even the pundits and the misinformed who blamed Bill Gates, Chinese Americans, or some fictional cult. Each and every person sought to—even in the most minute way—help defeat the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today was a reminder of that. We all learnt of the infections. We all worked to stop the spread. No one did it the same way, but we all did it.&nbsp;<br>If I have learnt anything from the global pandemic that continues to ravage our lives, it is this: it is humanity’s job to fix humanity’s problems, and <strong>everyone</strong> is doing their part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We started our day with a fast wakeup and our usual Special K breakfast. We arrived at eight at the Hui Nalu Halau for a morning of outrigger canoeing. We got a quick lesson about the difference between more modern canoes versus more traditional canoes made out of koa wood. The traditionally crafted canoes take over two years to build, and that’s after the 50 years that it takes for the tree to grow. Due to the labor and skill necessary to craft such a vessel, these canoes can cost in the neighborhood one hundred thousand dollars. We used our combined might to get the over 400-lb boats into the water, at which point we loaded up into two separate double-hull canoes and paddled away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the lead of a few of the club members and teachers, including but not limited to Jeff, KT, and Liz, we learned how to properly hold the paddles and synchronize our strokes. Every twelve strokes, the person in the chair closest to the bow (known as “first chair”), yells “hut”. While one takes their last stroke, you acknowledge with “hoe” and switch sides. We paddled around Maunalua Bay, learning tidbits of history and nautical navigation and feeling the swells rise and fall beneath us. A mutiny of splashing took place which resulted in inter- and intra-boat warfare. Soaked, we paddled back to shore. We were greeted with malasadas, which are fluffy balls of sugary heaven, and Anne Marie, a story-catcher of the Hawaiian history of Maunalua Bay. Anne Marie shared the stories and the history of the area, and it was clear to see the impact of the development of the area. In fact, we were sitting on man-made ground and it was hard to imagine how such a now-populated area could have once been a prosperous fish pond that opened up to the ocean. What we learned from this conversation was yet another demonstration between western expansion and the perseverance of native Hawaiian culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We then went back and relaxed at the farm for a few hours. This was a much needed recuperation time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After some down time, we were on our way to reunite with the entire Risch family, this time also including Chelsea’s partner, who was on island for work. Mike and Graham Risch are both associated with the Air Force and were able to host us on Bellows Air Force Station. Maile taught us how to cook luau, letting us participate in the process. Lu’au is a traditional Hawaiian delicacy made of Kalo leaves, coconut milk, vegetable broth, purple sweet potatoes, carrots and onions, all served over rice. We each used this time to foster our individual needs, either by swimming, journaling, chatting, or helping in the kitchen. We ended the evening watching the lunar eclipse and sending a group selfie to the Iceland crew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we got new insight into the culture that we have been hearing about and experiencing for the past 12 days. At this point in the trip, we feel a sense of ohana, or family, amongst ourselves and it was nice to reconnect with another family. Hawaii is often called the melting pot of many different cultures. These last two weekends barbecuing with the Risch family have been a chance to experience that in a cross between American and Hawaiian cultures. The smoky scent of the grill combined with the lovely aroma of the lu’au reminded us of this fact.</p>

<p>After a great night’s sleep, it was rather wonderful to not wake up to the screeches of chickens. With a great start to the day, we had a wonderful breakfast of bagels with a side of ocean breeze and took off on a tour of the island with our esteemed guide, Mark the marine biologist. As we journeyed around the island, Mark explained more of the history of the island, starting off as the living place of a seaweed collector, then switching hands between the military and millionaire playboys several times. Eventually, the island ended up as a science lab, sponsored by one of the less playboy millionaires. Today, the island is home to a couple private residents, the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, and visiting researchers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://elijahpotter.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/28-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-275" srcset="https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/28-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/28-225x300.jpg 225w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/28-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/28-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/28-2000x2667.jpg 2000w, https://10.0.0.65/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/28-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>The group picking up sea urchins, coral, and sea cucumbers in the touch pool</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the end of the tour, we gathered at a touch tank full of corals, urchins, and sea cucumbers. We were excited to take part in a bit of childish fun mixed in with useful (and at times random) information from Mark’s seemingly infinite sources of knowledge, varying from the structure of coral to general life advice, ex: How to get an internship in a lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We gathered our bags and made our way to the ferry for a short but thoughtful ride back to the mainland of Oahu. Unlike most of our other visits, the connection to culture seemed less apparent at first. However, after a moment of consideration, Mark’s career path as well as his work displays an intense passion for the land and ocean, displaying his Kuleana prominently. He is dedicated to stewarding the ocean to provide a healthy and educational environment for generations to come. Finally, we arrived back at the mainland.  </p>



<p>After a brief loss of the van keys, we finally took off, heading back to the Le Jardin farm and our wonderful chicken friends. After a short ride, we arrived back at the farm and set up our camp, remembering the wonderful moments from our earlier stay at the farm. We enjoyed a moment of rest before gathering our laundry for a much needed wash.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very excited to have another laundry day, we set off for Kailua. We got our clothes loaded up efficiently, minus the many trips to the change machine for quarters. As our clothes spun around, we enjoyed the breeze from the open garage doors and read our books.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Afterwards, we had an hour to explore Kailua town. Many students got smoothies and shopped for souvenirs and gifts for loved ones back home. One of the shopkeepers was excited to see so many kids from Colorado because she loves the state and used to work there!</p>



<p>It was interesting to step into the tourist world of tchotchke shops and mass-produced replicas of culturally significant objects. It&#8217;s a stark contrast to the in-depth experience we’ve been having so far. As much as I love walking around and shopping, it felt strange and disappointing to pass by many near-identical storefronts and crowds of visitors for whom this is their primary view of Hawai‘i.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we returned to the farm, we took the much cooler weather as an opportunity to do a trash pickup around the house. We were excited to help the Wild Kids crew. We found a handful of old cassette tapes in the dirt that Elijah is going to use for an art project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After quickly filling the trash bag and sufficiently washing our hands, it was time to prepare dinner. We had a Queen sing-along as half of the group cooked and the other worked on blog writing and editing. After a mouth-watering meal of fajitas, we parted ways to enjoy another night in Hawaiian paradise.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning! Raina and Josh here &#8211; welcome back to another fabulous blog post of just another fabulous day in Hawai’i! We had a slow wake up to a somewhat pathetic sunrise (nothing is really pathetic in Hawai’i however), coffee, chess, and packing up. Today was the day we said goodbye to our campsite of the past three days &#8211; a beautiful, basically beachfront cabin on a beach, called Malaekahana on the North Shore. We had the usual breakfast, accompanied by the first of three happy birthday songs to Raina. Despite the fact that it was her birthday, Ari Dor, or as we call him Dari Or, barely eeked out a win against her in an intense game of chess. We packed up our stuff, did some Tetris to fit it all into the car, and sent Chelsea on her way with all our luggage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once we had nothing but ourselves and our overnight bags, we plopped down on the sand for a quick pre-lab lesson from Becky on ocean acidification. She (re)introduced numerous concepts, mainly surrounding the terminology of ocean acidification, and the fancy equation for how carbon dioxide reacts with and gets absorbed into the water. We also tested the pH of a couple liquids, mostly just to play around. We tested a small stream, the ocean, and then our own spit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After concluding the necessary steps to be fully prepared for Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) we set off towards Coconut Island, the location of the research center. Thirty minutes into the drive we stopped at a local factory to get poi, a Hawaiian staple of ground and beaten taro root that has been cooked down to a paste with the consistency of a thick creamy porridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We then continued the drive and took a short boat shuttle to the island of coconuts, also known as Gilligan’s island, or Moku O Lo’e (Island of Lo’e). As soon as we arrived we shuttled our stuff up and immediately jumped into a much more in depth lab on ocean acidification. We broke out into three different groups, and did a brief walk around the island in order to get ocean samples from different areas. We did this in order to compare the pH and alkalinity of them, and hypothesize why they may be different. Most of our hypotheses were similar: the sandy beach would have the highest alkalinity, and the deeper area with no sand would have the lowest. For context, pH is the level of acidity within a liquid, and alkalinity is how resistant the liquid is to changes in the pH level. Once we got back, we had a more in depth overview of what ocean acidification is, and how it would actually affect the ocean environment in the long run. The results followed roughly what the hypotheses were, the water in the deepest area was the most amiable to alkaline dampening. The water on the rough water beach was much less amiable, with the shallow and unsandy water having some effect, but not a major change. This may sound simple after the fact, but the actual results we first got were much more along the lines of “ocean acidification is very complicated and doesn’t have one straightforward answer”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After having a brief discussion about the result, we were introduced to Mark, the education coordinator at the institute. He showed us where we would be setting up our tents, introduced us to the history of the island, and just talked story for a bit before directing us down to eat our yummy dinner of packed turkey and cheese sandwiches. While we were hanging out, chatting and eating, there was a surprise cake celebration for Raina that included an accidental slap of Jenna’s GoPro out of her hand while Raina was blowing out the candles, ending with a very funny video of the whole moment. We all enjoyed the cake and even had a veggie off (a Watershed classic game where two people have a “cowboy duel” where you imitate an adjective and a vegetable) to determine who got the last piece of cake. Elijah won with a very fantastic interpretation of a “stinky cantaloupe”.&nbsp; After, we headed back up to the classroom to start our nighttime lab with Mark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark introduced plankton and all of their glory to us with a short interactive side show. We then prepared for the night lab, where we would be collecting plankton samples from the bay. We were attracting plankton with light, and in order to make it in true experimental fashion, we each chose a different color of LED. We put the light&nbsp; into a small contraption, which was basically just half a liter of tinfoil. Of all the different light colors, plain white light was by far the most effective, with literal swarms of plankton circling around the light. The white light is easier for plankton and fish to see, so that’s why the white light had the most plankton, and all the other lighter colors had more as well. After collecting sufficient samples, we headed back up to the lab, where we placed small samples of plankton under the microscope. We saw all kinds of different species, from Lucifers with their curved shrimp-like structure, to Chaetognatha with their large outward “T” shaped jaws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the lab, and all of the post-lab discussion, we lounged around hearing Mark talk on and on about a variety of subjects over orange slices and the first cold beverages we’ve had this trip;</p>



<p>After an absolutely amazing day with lots of knowledge that filled our brains up like balloons, we were all completely zombified. We all hustled to bed after saying goodnight to Mark, and passed out Immediately after.</p>

<p>Overall today was a great opportunity to combine all of the cultural context that we had building up all trip, with some highly relevant scientific knowledge. Providing another perspective for all the cultural aspects we have been learning about, specifically surrounding animals and connections to the land. It gave us a great perspective on how connected and cognizant of the ocean polynesian settlers needed to be, in order to have the minuscule impact that they had. We learned so much about ocean acidification and plankton, and overall we had a great chance to have a science break from all of the humanities whorl that we have been doing so far.</p>

<p>Wind whistled across the waves. Clouds blocked the sky, barley allowing the sunlight to pierce through as it peaked above the horizon. Small holes scattered the beach, housing small crabs before their morning scurry across the sand. It was mostly vacant from humans, with only a man building sandcastles in the dawn light and a few students hoping to catch a glimpse of the sun across the water. The waves crashed on the smooth sand where footprints would soon be. The few rays of sun able to break through the clouds reflected on the water, shimmering like a sapphire in the light.</p>



<p>After an optional early wake up to see the sunrise, we ate a quick breakfast and got straight to work. We worked on updating the blog and our reading assignment. We shared questions we have been contemplating while reading. Questions relating to the course, the story, or other wonderings. A large number of questions related to colonial impacts on Hawai`i. As the two of us are reading the same book, <em>Moloka`i</em>, we had similar questions about the ways in which outside influence greatly affected Hawai`i. We also wondered about the different responses people had, and the choices people made to cope with an unfortunate situation, such as the leprosy outbreak covered in our book. Another student posed the question of the way pre-existing culture and religion affected or altered the Christianity brought by the missionaries. We feel that these questions further our thinking, and broaden the curiosity in our own minds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We scarfed down a speedy lunch of sandwiches and potato chips, only the healthiest of sides, of course. We returned to Kawainui Marsh in the afternoon. Joining some of the freshman Le Jardin students, we played a few traditional Hawaiian games. These games were used by ancient Hawaiian warriors to train. In Hawaiian culture there were rules of when the warriors could fight, and these games were practiced during the peace season—called Makahiki season—spanning from November to April. The games we played included Ulu Maika (lawn bowling), Oo Ihe (spear throwing), Hukihuki (tug of war), Hakka Moa (standing chicken fight), and Pa Uma (standing arm wrestling). There were more games played traditionally, but we just played these ones. For Ulu Maika we stood behind a border and rolled round rocks with the goal of making it between two sticks posted in the ground about 20 feet away. For Oo Ihe we chose a distance from a banana tree trunk and threw a sharpened stick attempting to pierce the stump. Hukihuki was played the same way as the tug of war we grew up playing in Colorado. For Hakka Mona two people stood in a ring, held each other&#8217;s right hand while standing on one foot. The two people then pushed and pulled each other attempting to get them out of the ring, while hopping around like chickens—the inspiration for the name. For Pa Uma two people stood facing each other with the outside of their right foot against one another, they held right hands and attempted to move each other&#8217;s right foot, with free movement of their left foot. Our favorite was Hakka Moa, both to do and to watch. It was a lot of fun to balance on one foot and maneuver your body and arm in a way to direct the other person where you wanted them. It was also fun to see two people holding hands and hopping around. It was fascinating to experience something similar to ancient culture rather than just learning about it. It was also a good bonding experience between our group and LJA students.</p>



<p>After tiring from the games, we gathered in a circle, talked story, and had an impromptu lei making lesson with Ka`ai, the Hawaiian culture teacher at LJA. She was also the one who had introduced the games. We made ti tree leis by deboning the leaves and using our nails to split the leaves into strands. We also (attempted) to learn how to make roses from palm fronds. The leis were very fun and relaxing; the roses were a bit more frustrating but still very cool to learn. Ka`ai spoke to us about current and past Hawaiian culture, and the reasons for the changes. She gave us her definition of kuleana, saying it is more than responsibility, it is also a right. She answered all of our questions and told us the stories of her life as well as her family’s. Her family is native to Hawai`i, and her father was one of the first Hawaiians to go to medical school. He still practices traditional Hawaiian medicine, along with modern medicine. It was enjoyable to learn about Ka`ai’s story and make connections to the themes of kuleana and the impacts colonization had on Hawaiian culture that have popped up in previous conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, we took a quick dip in the ocean water and followed it with some nice beach showers. For dinner we had a Kurmet Kraft mac and cheese meal cooked up by some students. Toppings included: broccoli, chicken sausage and a single can of Spam from Boulder by Elijah. Wrapping up the day, we had time to share out stories from our solo. Solo experiences included digging holes to sit in, observing photoshoots (that we assume will end up on Instagram), and reflection.</p>



<p>We got to experience Hawaiian traditions, talk with enjoyable company, and have time to ourselves. The perfect balance. It was a unique experience to both play a variety of games as well as make beautiful accessories only utilizing nature. Overall, the day was both educational and fun.</p>

<p>This morning many of us were rudely awakened by a particularly intense game of chess, and Ari scream singing “brass monkey, that funky monkey, brass monky junky that funky monkey” which is obviously the most pleasant way to possibly wake up.</p>



<p>After everyone was settled in we set off to begin a day of plastics and sand. When we arrived at Kahuku golf course we could see the Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii trucks lined up, ready for us to help with the beach cleanup effort. Before we began we got brief introductions to the surrounding area, and the volunteers we would be working with. We also talked story with Chloe, one of the volunteers we were working with, who lived aboard one of the Sea Shepherd vessels. Among the stories she told was how she would wait for illegal fishermen in the dead of night, with all ship lights off, to arrest them. She mentioned how she had been shot at, been boarded by pirates, and how much illegal fishermen hated the Sea Shepherd. She explained how much that experience had changed her, and how she looked at the world. Specifically, the decision she had to make when she got back home to either go back to an oblivious life or to make a change with herself to balance a comfortable life and making an impact.</p>

<p>After our discussions, we began the beach cleanup. We were initially confused because of how little plastic we saw. It was only after we took our first sifterfull of sand that we noticed the scale of the issue. In each square foot of sand, there must have been hundreds of pieces of plastic that we could see, and thousands we couldn’t. While sifting, many of us had meaningful discussions with the Sustainable Coastlines volunteers. Among the topics discussed were the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and how much the unsustainable fishing industry affects the plastic problem.</p>



<p>After an hour or so of sifting, we had a short reflection circle, where we talked about the feelings that come with having a seemingly insignificant impact. This introduced us to the concept of “1000 imperfects is better than one perfect,” meaning that as long as we try in some way, even if it isn’t perfect, it’s still making a difference, and as long as 1000 people do one action imperfectly, a large difference can be made, much greater than if only one person did it perfectly. After that we headed back to the cabins for a meatball lunch prepared the night before by Trevor, another one of the volunteers. He shared that all of the meat and most of the vegetables had been farmed and hunted on Oahu. While eating lunch we were able to chat with the people we had been working with in a much more casual manner. We ended up discussing all kinds of things, from life in Hawaii to the small farmers market just up the road.</p>



<p>After lunch we were visited by a few people representing the Oahu Water Protectors. They told us about Red Hill, the hundreds of millions of gallons of jet fuel stored above Oahu’s main water source, which supplies over 400,000 people with water. With this, the idea of having literal jet fuel pouring out of people&#8217;s sinks became reality for some, and the future for others. The prospect of having to periodically light drinking water on fire, is also becoming equally as real.</p>



<p>Afterwards we had a brief reflection circle, and swiftly transitioned into some much needed beach and ocean time, which served as an excellent break from the go-go-go and lectures that the day had brought on so far.</p>

<p>Then, to fulfil the Watershed tradition, we were all sent off onto a two hour solo, with the intent being that we reflect on the events and activities that we have experienced and absorbed on the trip so far. This is also the time that the two of us drafted this very blog post (ooh meta). After the solo we returned in silence and began an extended closing circle, where we talked about all the general themes that we had seen and heard from experts so far. We discussed the concept of Kuleana, and how all of the people that we have met have seemed to have a calling to try and make this island a better place. Beyond that we also discussed what things we have been hearing that we would like to bring back with us to Colorado. The main points being the hope and connectedness that comes with having a deeper level of understanding of the land and areas that we live on.</p>



<p>We learned so much today that made us reflect on how we can make a meaningful impact on the world by changing our lifestyles to be more sustainable.<br></p>



<p>In our current location we have limited access to internet. Images will be added as soon as we have a more reliable connection. </p>
