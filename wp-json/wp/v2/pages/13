My name is Liliana Kemna. I am 18 years of age, and am a senior. I enjoy taking very close-up photos of flowers, making plans to do crafts and rarely following through on them, and making food, which tends to get more follow through due to my frequent hunger as well as it being my source of income. I like animals -especially snakes- books -both fiction and non-fiction- and listen to far too many podcasts for the amount of time I have (this is why listening on faster speeds was invented). My favorite flower is hibiscus, and I am likely to drink any form of drink with hibiscus in it. Rosehip hibiscus tea is my favorite contender so far.\u00a0I\u2019m very excited for many aspects of this trip, but most importantly, simply visiting a place I have not been to before, and going on what I hope to be a thrilling new adventure.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:20% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"346\" height=\"888\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image8-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-138 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image8-1.png 346w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image8-1-117x300.png 117w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">My name is Carson Crawford and I am in 11th grade.

I fear becoming homesick, leaving my family and friends, and going into unfamiliar and potentially uncomfortable territory. I\u2019ve never been much of an outdoors kinda person, so spending 14 days in Hawaii is going to be an entirely new and different experience from anything I\u2019ve had.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 31%\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"674\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-674x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-674x1024.png 674w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1-198x300.png 198w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image1.png 710w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Hi, I\u2019m Asher.

I chose this course because I love the idea of studying island biology in sync with culture. I lived by the beach for 4 years and I have had a passion for the ocean ever since. I love marine life and studying everything ocean. I am really interested in studying Hawaii&#8217;s ecology and culture. I look forward to experiencing the ocean in a new place and meeting new people. I hope that I can gain a new appreciation for Hawaiian culture outside of the typical \u201ctourist view.\u201d I\u2019m slightly worried that I won\u2019t get as much ocean time as I want.

My main interests center around pretty much all super small chemistry-related topics, like microbiology, virology (nice and timely too!), and pretty much everything else within that general field. Beyond that, my main hobbies are running, reading, and overthinking every little assignment that I&#8217;m given. My main reason for choosing this may term was that it sounded interesting (duh). I\u2019m super excited to get a chance to experience part of a culture that I, frankly, know nothing about. Also, It\u2019s Hawaii! I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m particularly worried about anything, but as with all trips there&#8217;s the general sense of anxiety, pretty much about the whole entire thing, but that should pass as soon as we leave!<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:44% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image5.jpg 640w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/image5-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">My name is Ari Dor.\u00a0 My interests are computer hardware, fiction writing, and most of all, spaceflight.\u00a0 When I&#8217;m not on a computer of some sort, especially one of my own, you can likely find me reading a Sci-Fi book, writing, river surfing, or skiing. The thing that I\u2019m looking forward to most for the trip is working with Le Jardin, because I love meeting people, and doing service work is a great way to bond. The thing I am most anxious about, in all honesty, is sand. Anakin was right: \u201cIt&#8217;s coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.\u201d This is my cardinal truth.
