Unsurprisingly, our chicken friends were also wide awake, making their presence quite clear with loud remarks every five minutes or so. Drowsily, those of us who had emerged prepared to head out on a sunrise hike that promised to be a spectacular experience. Shortly after takeoff, we arrived in a local neighborhood, ready to start our excruciating mile-long hike. After a not-so-long hike, we reached a beautiful ridge overlooking the vast ocean below. Slowly, the sun began to rise from the depths of the ocean, greeting us with awaited Hawaiian sunrise. We took in the beauty of the surrounding land. With every breath we reflected on the privilege we have, wondering who had been in this exact place hundreds of years before us. After basking in the golden rays, we slowly walked back down, resisting the urge to give up such a spectacular sight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After driving back to camp, we were met with a group of enviously well-rested people. Admittedly, they seemed perfectly fine with missing the sunrise. Once we had eaten a quick breakfast, we all got to work packing up our camp. We prepared to head to Na Pohaku o Hauwahine for a day of Kuleana, giving back to the wonderful island of O\u2019ahu after six days of enjoying its splendor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the entire group was reunited, we departed to N\u0101 P\u014dhaku o Hauwahine, a site on Kawaninui marsh that locals are trying to restore. The drive there went off without a hitch, and we headed off to the work site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of getting right to work, we got a tour of the area, starting with an encounter with a man named Uncle Kimo. He gave us some interesting facts on some plants and herbs in the area, such as noni, a smelly plant which can cure over 15 diseases. Despite this, the noni could not hold a candle to what Kimo showed us next &#8211; his pig named Oompa. Oompa is there a curious little pig who loves his owners and isn\u2019t afraid to demand belly rubs from those who see him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we finally could bring ourselves to leave Oompa, we were given a short tour by Malia of the region. Malia continued to give us a tour while we had lunch and overviewed the area where we would contribute to restoring the Marsh, bit by bit. While we were up there, we were able to hear about how a once beautiful fish pond that fed thousands of families through fishing turned into a dead marsh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting a talk with Malia, we went down to the Amphitheater area and got to work. We had the task to pull the weeds, remove some of the invasive plants, and make room to plant native plants in the area, since this area had no native plants anywhere to speak of. We would be removing these weeds with pickaxes and shovels (they were big weeds) and planting the native plants through holes in a laid out weed cover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once time was up, we packed up our tools and said goodbye to our plants, to Kimo, but most unfortunately, Oompa. Moving on from there, we had the opportunity to visit Ulupo Heiau, a taro farm (also known as Khalo) and historically significant site.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we arrived at Ulupo Heiau, we were guided again by Malia. She explained the cultural significance of many of the visible structures, including the terraced ponds of Taro, a Hawaiian staple crop. This crop was essential to the native Hawaiians and was a huge part of daily life. Not only did it produce two baby plants per root, but it also produced extremely large corm, sometimes weighing up to 50 pounds. (That\u2019s a lot in case you didn\u2019t know). As we explored the soggy terraces, we were treated to a history of the location, learning about its Hawaiian caretakers who had tended the farm and the surrounding fish pond centuries earlier. Now, locals tend to the area as graciously as they did hundreds of years earlier, creating a place for all to experience traditions and tend to the once massive fish pond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we left the Khalo field, it was time to give our sweaty and gross bodies the showers they so deserved. These had to be quick though, because it would be a long drive to our next camping spot and we had to get food along the way. We went to a shower right down by the beach, and while our showers were slower than they should\u2019ve been, we got them done efficiently enough, and also got to have a 2-5 minute dip into the beach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it was time for the long haul, the hour long drive to our next campsite, Malaekahana. Becky and Chelsea knew that our hunger had to be quenched, so they took us to a grocery store named Foodland. Here, we could get ourselves various food items such as rice, chicken, and poke bolls. We were also permitted to buy normal grocery store food with our own money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our Hawaiian food and Oreos ready, we could now depart to the next campsite. Despite the setting sun and long drive, the car was pretty lively. Chatter could be heard the entire time, and when we finally got to camp, people were still as lively as they were in the morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This liveliness wouldn\u2019t last though, as the comfort of actual mattresses hit, we all fell asleep quickly. Whilst having some uncomfortable ants and dysfunctional toilets, the view of the ocean and the constant breeze of the wind was absolutely incredible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it\u2019s all said and done, we learned a lot from today. We were shown even more of the wondrous natural beauty of Hawaii, the difficulties of manual labor and bettering an environment, and learning more about the connection of Hawaiians and their land. After 7 awe-inspiring days on this remote archipelago, the connections between culture and environment are truly forming in our minds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/19-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-266\" width=\"638\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/19-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/19-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/19-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/19-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/19-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/19-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/22-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-269\" width=\"553\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/22-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/22-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/22-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/22-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/22-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/22-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/21-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-268\" width=\"576\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/21-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/21-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/21-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/21-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/21-2000x2667.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/21-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-267\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The blissful morning started as half our group woke up at the early hour of 4:30 am for an optional hike.
