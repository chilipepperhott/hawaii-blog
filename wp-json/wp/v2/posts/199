When we arrived at Kahuku golf course we could see the Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii trucks lined up, ready for us to help with the beach cleanup effort. Before we began we got brief introductions to the surrounding area, and the volunteers we would be working with. We also talked story with Chloe, one of the volunteers we were working with, who lived aboard one of the Sea Shepherd vessels. Among the stories she told was how she would wait for illegal fishermen in the dead of night, with all ship lights off, to arrest them. She mentioned how she had been shot at, been boarded by pirates, and how much illegal fishermen hated the Sea Shepherd. She explained how much that experience had changed her, and how she looked at the world. Specifically, the decision she had to make when she got back home to either go back to an oblivious life or to make a change with herself to balance a comfortable life and making an impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3250-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-308\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3250-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3250-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3250-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3250-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3250-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3250-1-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Elijah and Josh sifting for microplastics.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After our discussions, we began the beach cleanup. We were initially confused because of how little plastic we saw. It was only after we took our first sifterfull of sand that we noticed the scale of the issue. In each square foot of sand, there must have been hundreds of pieces of plastic that we could see, and thousands we couldn\u2019t. While sifting, many of us had meaningful discussions with the Sustainable Coastlines volunteers. Among the topics discussed were the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and how much the unsustainable fishing industry affects the plastic problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an hour or so of sifting, we had a short reflection circle, where we talked about the feelings that come with having a seemingly insignificant impact. This introduced us to the concept of \u201c1000 imperfects is better than one perfect,\u201d meaning that as long as we try in some way, even if it isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s still making a difference, and as long as 1000 people do one action imperfectly, a large difference can be made, much greater than if only one person did it perfectly. After that we headed back to the cabins for a meatball lunch prepared the night before by Trevor, another one of the volunteers. He shared that all of the meat and most of the vegetables had been farmed and hunted on Oahu. While eating lunch we were able to chat with the people we had been working with in a much more casual manner. We ended up discussing all kinds of things, from life in Hawaii to the small farmers market just up the road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After lunch we were visited by a few people representing the Oahu Water Protectors. They told us about Red Hill, the hundreds of millions of gallons of jet fuel stored above Oahu\u2019s main water source, which supplies over 400,000 people with water. With this, the idea of having literal jet fuel pouring out of people&#8217;s sinks became reality for some, and the future for others. The prospect of having to periodically light drinking water on fire, is also becoming equally as real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterwards we had a brief reflection circle, and swiftly transitioned into some much needed beach and ocean time, which served as an excellent break from the go-go-go and lectures that the day had brought on so far.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"227\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/0-1024x227.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/0-1024x227.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/0-300x66.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/0-768x170.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/0-1536x340.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/0-2048x454.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/0-2000x443.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>A panorama of our beach, shortly before solo.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, to fulfil the Watershed tradition, we were all sent off onto a two hour solo, with the intent being that we reflect on the events and activities that we have experienced and absorbed on the trip so far. This is also the time that the two of us drafted this very blog post (ooh meta). After the solo we returned in silence and began an extended closing circle, where we talked about all the general themes that we had seen and heard from experts so far. We discussed the concept of Kuleana, and how all of the people that we have met have seemed to have a calling to try and make this island a better place. Beyond that we also discussed what things we have been hearing that we would like to bring back with us to Colorado. The main points being the hope and connectedness that comes with having a deeper level of understanding of the land and areas that we live on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We learned so much today that made us reflect on how we can make a meaningful impact on the world by changing our lifestyles to be more sustainable.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our current location we have limited access to internet.
