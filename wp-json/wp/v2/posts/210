Clouds blocked the sky, barley allowing the sunlight to pierce through as it peaked above the horizon. Small holes scattered the beach, housing small crabs before their morning scurry across the sand. It was mostly vacant from humans, with only a man building sandcastles in the dawn light and a few students hoping to catch a glimpse of the sun across the water. The waves crashed on the smooth sand where footprints would soon be. The few rays of sun able to break through the clouds reflected on the water, shimmering like a sapphire in the light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an optional early wake up to see the sunrise, we ate a quick breakfast and got straight to work. We worked on updating the blog and our reading assignment. We shared questions we have been contemplating while reading. Questions relating to the course, the story, or other wonderings. A large number of questions related to colonial impacts on Hawai`i. As the two of us are reading the same book, <em>Moloka`i<\/em>, we had similar questions about the ways in which outside influence greatly affected Hawai`i. We also wondered about the different responses people had, and the choices people made to cope with an unfortunate situation, such as the leprosy outbreak covered in our book. Another student posed the question of the way pre-existing culture and religion affected or altered the Christianity brought by the missionaries. We feel that these questions further our thinking, and broaden the curiosity in our own minds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We scarfed down a speedy lunch of sandwiches and potato chips, only the healthiest of sides, of course. We returned to Kawainui Marsh in the afternoon. Joining some of the freshman Le Jardin students, we played a few traditional Hawaiian games. These games were used by ancient Hawaiian warriors to train. In Hawaiian culture there were rules of when the warriors could fight, and these games were practiced during the peace season\u2014called Makahiki season\u2014spanning from November to April. The games we played included Ulu Maika (lawn bowling), Oo Ihe (spear throwing), Hukihuki (tug of war), Hakka Moa (standing chicken fight), and Pa Uma (standing arm wrestling). There were more games played traditionally, but we just played these ones. For Ulu Maika we stood behind a border and rolled round rocks with the goal of making it between two sticks posted in the ground about 20 feet away. For Oo Ihe we chose a distance from a banana tree trunk and threw a sharpened stick attempting to pierce the stump. Hukihuki was played the same way as the tug of war we grew up playing in Colorado. For Hakka Mona two people stood in a ring, held each other&#8217;s right hand while standing on one foot. The two people then pushed and pulled each other attempting to get them out of the ring, while hopping around like chickens\u2014the inspiration for the name. For Pa Uma two people stood facing each other with the outside of their right foot against one another, they held right hands and attempted to move each other&#8217;s right foot, with free movement of their left foot. Our favorite was Hakka Moa, both to do and to watch. It was a lot of fun to balance on one foot and maneuver your body and arm in a way to direct the other person where you wanted them. It was also fun to see two people holding hands and hopping around. It was fascinating to experience something similar to ancient culture rather than just learning about it. It was also a good bonding experience between our group and LJA students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After tiring from the games, we gathered in a circle, talked story, and had an impromptu lei making lesson with Ka`ai, the Hawaiian culture teacher at LJA. She was also the one who had introduced the games. We made ti tree leis by deboning the leaves and using our nails to split the leaves into strands. We also (attempted) to learn how to make roses from palm fronds. The leis were very fun and relaxing; the roses were a bit more frustrating but still very cool to learn. Ka`ai spoke to us about current and past Hawaiian culture, and the reasons for the changes. She gave us her definition of kuleana, saying it is more than responsibility, it is also a right. She answered all of our questions and told us the stories of her life as well as her family\u2019s. Her family is native to Hawai`i, and her father was one of the first Hawaiians to go to medical school. He still practices traditional Hawaiian medicine, along with modern medicine. It was enjoyable to learn about Ka`ai\u2019s story and make connections to the themes of kuleana and the impacts colonization had on Hawaiian culture that have popped up in previous conversation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, we took a quick dip in the ocean water and followed it with some nice beach showers. For dinner we had a Kurmet Kraft mac and cheese meal cooked up by some students. Toppings included: broccoli, chicken sausage and a single can of Spam from Boulder by Elijah. Wrapping up the day, we had time to share out stories from our solo. Solo experiences included digging holes to sit in, observing photoshoots (that we assume will end up on Instagram), and reflection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got to experience Hawaiian traditions, talk with enjoyable company, and have time to ourselves. The perfect balance. It was a unique experience to both play a variety of games as well as make beautiful accessories only utilizing nature. Overall, the day was both educational and fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"659\" height=\"879\" data-id=\"219\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0625.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-219\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0625.jpg 659w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0625-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" \/><figcaption>A Pa Uma match between Watershed students<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"659\" height=\"879\" data-id=\"220\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0627.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-220\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0627.jpg 659w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0627-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" \/><figcaption>A cross-school round of Hakka Moa<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"221\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0629-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-221\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0629-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0629-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0629-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0629.jpg 1172w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Ti leaf lei making lessons<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"222\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3404-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3404-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3404-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3404-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3404.jpg 1172w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Gifting Malia a flower lei in honor of her graduating from grad school the following day<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"218\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3407-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-218\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3407-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3407-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3407-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3407.jpg 1172w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Burring Ari in the sand<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wind whistled across the waves.
