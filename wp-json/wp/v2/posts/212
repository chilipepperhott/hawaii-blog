Raina and Josh here &#8211; welcome back to another fabulous blog post of just another fabulous day in Hawai\u2019i! We had a slow wake up to a somewhat pathetic sunrise (nothing is really pathetic in Hawai\u2019i however), coffee, chess, and packing up. Today was the day we said goodbye to our campsite of the past three days &#8211; a beautiful, basically beachfront cabin on a beach, called Malaekahana on the North Shore. We had the usual breakfast, accompanied by the first of three happy birthday songs to Raina. Despite the fact that it was her birthday, Ari Dor, or as we call him Dari Or, barely eeked out a win against her in an intense game of chess. We packed up our stuff, did some Tetris to fit it all into the car, and sent Chelsea on her way with all our luggage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we had nothing but ourselves and our overnight bags, we plopped down on the sand for a quick pre-lab lesson from Becky on ocean acidification. She (re)introduced numerous concepts, mainly surrounding the terminology of ocean acidification, and the fancy equation for how carbon dioxide reacts with and gets absorbed into the water. We also tested the pH of a couple liquids, mostly just to play around. We tested a small stream, the ocean, and then our own spit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After concluding the necessary steps to be fully prepared for Hawai\u2019i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) we set off towards Coconut Island, the location of the research center. Thirty minutes into the drive we stopped at a local factory to get poi, a Hawaiian staple of ground and beaten taro root that has been cooked down to a paste with the consistency of a thick creamy porridge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then continued the drive and took a short boat shuttle to the island of coconuts, also known as Gilligan\u2019s island, or Moku O Lo\u2019e (Island of Lo\u2019e). As soon as we arrived we shuttled our stuff up and immediately jumped into a much more in depth lab on ocean acidification. We broke out into three different groups, and did a brief walk around the island in order to get ocean samples from different areas. We did this in order to compare the pH and alkalinity of them, and hypothesize why they may be different. Most of our hypotheses were similar: the sandy beach would have the highest alkalinity, and the deeper area with no sand would have the lowest. For context, pH is the level of acidity within a liquid, and alkalinity is how resistant the liquid is to changes in the pH level. Once we got back, we had a more in depth overview of what ocean acidification is, and how it would actually affect the ocean environment in the long run. The results followed roughly what the hypotheses were, the water in the deepest area was the most amiable to alkaline dampening. The water on the rough water beach was much less amiable, with the shallow and unsandy water having some effect, but not a major change. This may sound simple after the fact, but the actual results we first got were much more along the lines of \u201cocean acidification is very complicated and doesn\u2019t have one straightforward answer\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After having a brief discussion about the result, we were introduced to Mark, the education coordinator at the institute. He showed us where we would be setting up our tents, introduced us to the history of the island, and just talked story for a bit before directing us down to eat our yummy dinner of packed turkey and cheese sandwiches. While we were hanging out, chatting and eating, there was a surprise cake celebration for Raina that included an accidental slap of Jenna\u2019s GoPro out of her hand while Raina was blowing out the candles, ending with a very funny video of the whole moment. We all enjoyed the cake and even had a veggie off (a Watershed classic game where two people have a \u201ccowboy duel\u201d where you imitate an adjective and a vegetable) to determine who got the last piece of cake. Elijah won with a very fantastic interpretation of a \u201cstinky cantaloupe\u201d.&nbsp; After, we headed back up to the classroom to start our nighttime lab with Mark.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark introduced plankton and all of their glory to us with a short interactive side show. We then prepared for the night lab, where we would be collecting plankton samples from the bay. We were attracting plankton with light, and in order to make it in true experimental fashion, we each chose a different color of LED. We put the light&nbsp; into a small contraption, which was basically just half a liter of tinfoil. Of all the different light colors, plain white light was by far the most effective, with literal swarms of plankton circling around the light. The white light is easier for plankton and fish to see, so that\u2019s why the white light had the most plankton, and all the other lighter colors had more as well. After collecting sufficient samples, we headed back up to the lab, where we placed small samples of plankton under the microscope. We saw all kinds of different species, from Lucifers with their curved shrimp-like structure, to Chaetognatha with their large outward \u201cT\u201d shaped jaws.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the lab, and all of the post-lab discussion, we lounged around hearing Mark talk on and on about a variety of subjects over orange slices and the first cold beverages we\u2019ve had this trip;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an absolutely amazing day with lots of knowledge that filled our brains up like balloons, we were all completely zombified. We all hustled to bed after saying goodnight to Mark, and passed out Immediately after.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" data-id=\"264\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-264\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" data-id=\"274\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/27-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-274\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/27-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/27-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/27-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/27-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/27-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/27-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/27-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-id=\"273\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/26.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-273\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/26.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/26-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/26-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/26-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/26-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" data-id=\"275\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-scaled.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-2000x2667.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall today was a great opportunity to combine all of the cultural context that we had building up all trip, with some highly relevant scientific knowledge. Providing another perspective for all the cultural aspects we have been learning about, specifically surrounding animals and connections to the land. It gave us a great perspective on how connected and cognizant of the ocean polynesian settlers needed to be, in order to have the minuscule impact that they had. We learned so much about ocean acidification and plankton, and overall we had a great chance to have a science break from all of the humanities whorl that we have been doing so far.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning!
