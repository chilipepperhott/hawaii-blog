Sweat was forming in Ari\u2019s brow as Becky ravaged his pieces for over two hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the remainder of the Special K, the group assembled to discuss the plans for the day. That is: absolutely nothing. For the first time after four days of nonstop, edge of the seat action, we had a day to ourselves for rest and recuperation. While the fine grain layout of the day was relatively open, the intention was clear: continue reading our assigned books. Each person immersed themselves in a book, allowing their imaginations to recreate the landscapes of a less developed Hawaii, tens, hundreds or even thousands of years ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/6-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-261\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/6-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/6-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/6-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/6-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/6-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Jenna relaxing in a tree swing, reading her book<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jenna and Liliana followed the gripping tale of a young woman fighting leprosy in the book <em>Moloka\u2019i<\/em> by Alan Brennert. The story moves from the island of O\u2019ahu to the leprosy encampment on Moloka\u2019i. The story follows the protagonist through her childhood and young adulthood as she lives a life in isolation from her family. The story works to provide an approachable history of how a tragic epidemic was handled by colonists and Hawaiians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the assistance of their imaginations, as well as Sarah Vowell\u2019s book, <em>Unfamiliar Fishes<\/em>, Ari and Carson watched the swift invasion of American missionaries, and the subsequent agricultural and cultural genocide.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua read a first person account of modern-day explorers as they set out to cross the ocean in the same kind of outrigger canoe that Polynesians used to initially colonize the Hawaiian islands. With the assistance of the night sky, the author of the book (<em>Hawaiki Rising)<\/em>, Sam Low and his posse successfully made it to Tahiti. By only using traditional Polynesian navigation practices, the group demonstrated their effectiveness, and sparked a cultural revival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elijah, Raina and Zach read about one of Hawaii\u2019s most imfamous court cases: the supposed rape and assault of a white navyman\u2019s wife by local teens. Taking place in 1930s Honolulu, the book conveys (in somewhat gratuitous detail) the night of the supposed event, as well as the following racial tensions and controversy it ignited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keira took a more broad perspective. In <em>Voyagers: The Settlement of the Pacific, <\/em>author Nicholas Thomas embarks on a critical analysis of the Hawaiian Islands, in addition to parts of Oceania. The book&#8217;s many vectors of study\u2013including archeology, anthropology, and linguistics\u2013provides a nuanced idea of the archipelago\u2019s history and a somewhat different perspective from the other books.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <em>Shark Dialogs<\/em>, Asher received the accounts of many generations of a single Hawaiian family, chronicling their losses. There is an element of rage that pervades the book, reflecting author Kiana Davenport\u2019s feelings about the colonization of the Hawaiian Islands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After our time spent at the LJA farm, the group departed to the Risch family&#8217;s household &#8211; in Chelsea\u2019s words, \u201cher Hanai family\u201d. A golden opportunity arose with this visit, as Mike, Corinne, and Maile Risch had themselves a washing machine and dryer &#8211; technology we hadn\u2019t seen in days. Thus we brought all of our filthy clothes in separate trash bags and we washed them in groups of two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Risch family gave us a warm welcome with a barbecue night and some burgers for us all, accompanied by Funyuns and seaweed, among other delicious snacks. We observed&nbsp; an entertaining demonstration of the Hawaiian humidity: when we left the seaweed out for a measly 10 minutes, it returned to its natural wet state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spent our time at the Risch household chatting with the lively and fascinating Corinne, Mike, and Maile, playing ping pong and pool, and waiting for our clothes to finish. We were accompanied by Winston and Josie, their dogs. Josie is a sweet, snuggly goldendoodle, and Winston an eager, energetic hippo. Although our fun could not be understated, some of us knew that we needed time to work on our blogs and books, thus we utilized some of the gracious free time we had been gifted to work these very assignments on a lanai under the peaks of the Koolau mountains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3026-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-311\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3026-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3026-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3026-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3026-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3026-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_3026-1-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As time ran dry though, we knew we had to wrap things up and say our goodbyes. We thanked them for washing our clothes (which we wouldn\u2019t get until the next day) and drove back in the van to the campsite. Most of us had fallen asleep on the way back, therefore Chelsea and Becky knew that our traditional ending circle had to be done in a jiffy to allow us the sleep time we needed.&nbsp;<br>Traveling and learning in the field is stressful &#8211; for the body <strong>and <\/strong>the soul. Today was a practice in recognizing that limit and a mindful choice: taking a break. This is a long trip, with a lot of content, so it will not be remembered as a sprint, but rather a practice of endurance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After finally being able to sleep in, the group trickled slowly toward the coffee, waking intermittently with the soft, soothing call of screaming chickens.
