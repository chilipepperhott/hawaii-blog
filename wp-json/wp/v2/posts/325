Here are their thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liliana<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The experiences of this trip both confirmed and strengthened previous interests as well as introduced exciting new ones. It gave me new lenses through which to view the world, some from a creation standpoint and some to take forward hopefully far into the future. This trip was so culturally rich, a topic which I find fascinating, and the lack of language barrier made it far more accessible. I truly felt that I could just soak the culture in, like a sponge with water. Culture exists in Hawai\u055di not just in native Hawaiian traditions, but in the communities of children growing up there, as well as many people who have only just recently found their residence there. (All of the people we spoke to, at least, I\u2019m sure there are some of the more \u2018touristy\u2019 types as well.) One aspect of the culture that really stood out to me is the deep connection with place that so many people have. It is not something that you can find as much here. Sure, there are many people very grateful to the land, people appreciate the space they live. Gardeners and farmers and park rangers all have a connection to the land, but there is something different about the quality of connection. There is an additional level of respect for the land, history, and people that make a place: home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Joshua<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over my time in Hawaii, the most impactful thing that I had learned about and experienced was how centered around self-reflection the Hawaiian culture seemed to be. Everything that we learned about, from kuleana to the kilo observation techniques, seemed to have profound importance on knowing yourself and then using that to make a difference. The kuleana, from what we had heard and seen, was intended as a sense of responsibility; most people we had talked to had genuinely believed that it was their responsibility to pick up trash on the beach, replant native trees, or something else along that line. The most important one we had learned of over the trip was the Oli when we were tasked with declaring our intentions for being in a place to make sure that we were making the most out of the experience we were given. Beyond that, most of these people also felt that it was their responsibility to teach us. Once we are able, it will become our responsibility to teach the next generation to continue the cycle of caring for the land that we live on and protecting native agriculture.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elijah<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This course has been a constant reminder of the strength of the individual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Western culture, the U.S. especially, demonstrates that in every facet of life. A great example: Star Wars. Every clone soldier looks and behaves exactly the same; a single faceless enemy. Meanwhile, every protagonist is different and \u201cspecial\u201d. We are taught that we should also be different and special.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the longest time, I figured the main benefit of this tendency was a kind of culture biodiversity. If everyone tries to be different and unique, it becomes a lot easier to find solutions that haven\u2019t been explored before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all that may still be true, I now see it in a different light. Western culture was not just teaching us how to be, it was teaching us what to be: an individual person that has the power to make change. Western society is built by individuals, each working towards the betterment of their lives, and the lives of their community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The individual\u2019s story is also one of specialization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each individual does not need to effect change in all areas of their lives, they need to effect change by using one specific skill. A plumber, for example, can fix a broken sink in less than half the time an electrician can. That gives the electrician more time. A skilled engineer can pick up more plastic in the ocean, or carbon dioxide out of the air than a cook can in the same time. A lot more. But neither is necessarily more important to society. The engineer saves time by buying their food from the cook\u2019s restaurant. The cook, by proxy, has picked up a substantial amount more plastic than they would have otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialists are better and faster at their jobs. In an ideal world, there would be a person for each necessary skill or task. It would be efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am going to spend my time enhancing my main skills, and be a part of the grand experiment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jenna<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The trip to Hawaii can\u2019t be put into one word, or even one sentence. I learned so much about Hawaii as a place, and culture. I realized that though Hawaii is a state in the US, it seems like a completely different place. From the kindness and love that people have, to speaking pigeon (a mix of Hawaiian and English), it feels like a different country. Something especially different is all the unique food, we tried so many different foods that are only in Hawaii. People use food to show their love and appreciation, they also talk about it, show you how to make it or where to get it. I loved bonding with other high schoolers, adults, and my classmates through our shared experiences. Other than my newfound knowledge of Hawaii, and my recognition that there is still so much to learn, I had a big takeaway from this trip in particular. A trend on watershed trips is that I notice a way I can improve. In past trips it has mostly been mental change, outwardly shown by my confidence, or small fixes in how I think and carry myself. During this trip I realized that along with the mental growth I have obtained, I want to change something bigger. We spoke to Sustainable Coastline, a nonprofit organization, about how people fall into a hopeless mindset regarding climate change. I acknowledge that I have had the \u2018were practically doomed\u2019 mindset for a whyle, but I found hope talking to them. Even small actions I take by changing what I buy and eat can make a tiny difference, and I want to make that change in my life, as well as bring hope to people around me. Overall Hawaii was an amazing experience full of bonding, learning, and realizations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Carson<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>May term has been absolutely incredible. There aren\u2019t many other words that can describe it. Not many people have the opportunity to spend both spend two weeks in Hawaii, but also to spend that time intuitively learning about ecology, evolution, and history with real experts on each subject. The places we were able to explore, the people we met, and the unexpected bonds we developed with each other were all experiences that I will never be able to forget. The places I have had the privilege to go with Watershed have each been nothing short of the best experiences of my life, and this one has been absolutely no exception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside our trip and the experiences developed, this trip was able to give me much needed reflection time for myself. Gone were the stresses of everyday life back in Colorado, and here in Hawaii I could think about my family, friends, my future all with a clearer mind. The downtime we had has helped me shape who I truly am. The social experiences helped me realize my limits, the academic experiences helped me realize my capabilities, and I have helped me determine who I may truly be. Had this trip not happened, this self reflection wouldn\u2019t have been possible, and I don\u2019t know where I would be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zac<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our experience in Hawaii was, to say the least, transformative. The typical Hawaii experience of a white tourist from the continental United States is filled with entertainment and attractions, giving a sub-level spiritual experience. Tourists have never heard of Kuliana. Tourists have never heard of Aloha Aina. Tourists have never heard of the history of colonization. Tourists have never heard of Kilo. Our group has experienced Kuliana. Our group has experienced Aloha Aina. Our group has experienced the effects of colonization. Our group has experienced Kilo. Basking in the rich cultural history and the ecology of the place we are guests in changes the viewer&#8217;s experience so much. In a way, it binds you to the surrounding environment, making you one with your experience. Not only did we learn or hear about these things, we constantly practiced them over the course. Those 15 days have been exponentially impactful on each and every one of us, but I can only write for myself. I have been greatly impacted. Giving back to the environment and participating in a foreign culture changed my outlook on my own world. I find myself reaching into my home environment, being more observant of the surroundings, and being attentive to the waste I produce and the impact I have. Summed up, my Hawaii experience was, to say the least, unitive with my environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Asher<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hawaii was an amazing time, and I thoroughly miss it. From our experience there I realized a few things. First being there is a huge movement there to recapture, preserve, and maintain culture. Second, there is a huge movement for recreation of old Hawaii in terms of ecology, and plantlife. Finally, there are major movements to make Hawaii as close to old Hawaii as possible, which is pretty much the ultimate goal of the previous two. Of the people I asked in Hawaii what their eventual goal was, Malia&#8217;s answer stood out. She said her goal overall was to restore KawaiNui marsh back to what it was before, a full fish pond that people could go to, farm along the edges of, fish in, and recreate in. From her answer I wondered if that was the goal for the entire island, and due to some of the other things we did it seemed that was the goal. Of course Hawaii can not be made back into what it was before, because of the fact that so many of its native species have died, but the goal is to get it as close as possible in this new world. I\u2019m curious to see what happens in Hawaii over the course of my lifetime. I hope the people we interacted with achieve their goal but I hope it stays a nice vacation spot for many people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Raina<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I went into this trip with an incredible love for science and biology. I left with an even deeper meaning of why the work scientists do is important. In Hawai\u2019i, we spent countless hours doing service work, research, and learning the history of the place we were staying. From my time in Hawai\u2019i, I discovered a deeper meaning of the relevance that science has. Beside the fact that it\u2019s essential for developing a more sustainable future, I also realized how important it is for cultures. Creating and recreating thriving bioculture can bring together communities and people from all different backgrounds. I noticed this when we went to one of the farms in Hawai\u2019i. They were growing Kalo, as well as the community around them. Having a goal set in science and bettering the planet and finding people around you with the same beliefs and goals can create such a better outcome than solely doing science for science. My time in Hawai\u2019i made it even clearer to me that science is what I want to do with my life. I want to be able to help the planet and help people around me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we wrapped up the course, students took time to reflect on their time in Hawaii.
