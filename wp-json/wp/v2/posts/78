The day started with a review of a video and a short talk from Dr. Li about genomics and the different methods of genetic variation and evolution. Emily took some time to show us a small exhibit on snail shells and explained a historical event in Hawai\u02bbi where farmers released predatory snails to combat the snails that were acting as agricultural pests, and how this shift of species dynamic led to the extinction of many native snail species across the islands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:18px\">Our main activity was a research game to help us understand how the speciation of islands works. One table acted as the mainland and several pucks of wood across the room acted as islands, and the species were represented by different types of seashells that would be moved between them. We split into two teams in order to collect multiple data points, and began the activity. Some people acted as the forces that move species from the mainland to the islands: migratory birds and boats. Over the course of three minutes, they carried the shells from the mainland to the islands with a spoon. One person on each team sat by the island and removed one shell every 15-20 seconds, acting as the extinction force.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:18px\">After the physical portion of the activity was done, the data collection teams sorted and counted the different types of shells (species) and how many of each type there were, as well as the varying area of the islands and their distance from the mainland. We did two rounds of the activity, one where the islands were the same distance from the mainland but different sizes, and another where the islands were the same size but one was significantly further from the mainland.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:18px\">Each team analyzed the data and created graphs of the relationship between the components of the island and their end populations. The results showed that when the islands are the same distance from the mainland, there is a positive correlation between the size of the island and the number of different species and individuals present. When the islands are the same size but different distances, there is a negative correlation between distance and the number of species and individuals present.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"782\" data-id=\"107\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-141013-989-1024x782.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-107\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-141013-989-1024x782.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-141013-989-300x229.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-141013-989-768x587.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-141013-989.jpg 1414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"785\" data-id=\"109\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-140938-222-1024x785.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-109\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-140938-222-1024x785.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-140938-222-300x230.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-140938-222-768x589.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot_20220503-140938-222.jpg 1408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">After debriefing the activity, we had some time to explore the rest of the museum.
