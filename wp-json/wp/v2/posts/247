We all gathered around the dining room table for the last formal group meal. After we were all finished eating, we began to pack up the Vrbo; we packed out everything and two people ran to the store to get Becky and Keira some fun gifts for their remaining time on the island. After we were all packed up we went to Waikiki. Liliana and Julie delivered the gift bag to Becky and Keira and we all went to sit in the grass by the lagoon to have some group discussions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group sat in a circle, the lagoon water peaceful, hotels and tourist destinations towering above us. The ocean waves were a distant noise beside us, and pigeons scoured the grass for food scraps. To begin our discussion about the Bishop Museum, we reflected on our experiences in the two main exhibits: the Science Hall and the Hawaiian Hall. Beginning with the Science Hall, we found that the group had made a lot of connections from our previous learnings here. The museum had exhibits that talked about the role of volcanoes in creating the Hawaiian islands. These exhibits also explained the different types of igneous rocks that form based on the rate at which the lava cools, which determines the size of the crystals in the rocks. We spent time covering this before we left Colorado by watching various videos and hearing from a professor at Colorado School of Mines. There were also many exhibits on invasive plants and animals in Hawaii, information we have learned a lot about. There was a table with sand from different parts of Hawaii and information from what the sand was made of. There was one type of sand on the table called skeleton sand that is made from broken up shells and coral. This is the same type of sand we used as a buffer when we were doing a lab on ocean acidification. Next we went over things we learned. We learned more information on shield volcanoes, like how they form from thicker, cooler lava. Volcano glass is seen as different parts of Pele (the volcano goddess); glass droplets are Pele\u2019s tears, formed from drops of lava cooling quickly in water; thin glass strands, formed from pieces of rock pulling apart the lava as it cools is Pele&#8217;s hair; and Limo-o-Pele (Pele seaweed) is bubbling lava and glass shards quickly cooling in water creating a seaweed looking glass. Then we went over questions that came up such as, \u201dis it hard to tell whether or not a fish species is native to Hawaii?\u201d and, \u201dhow do underwater landslides form?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterwards, we transitioned to talking about the Hawaiian Hall. This part of the museum was detailed and included extensive information on many different aspects of Hawaii. There was so much information we could have all spent all day in the Hawaiian Hall. The Hall was divided into three categories-above, below and outward-the same three that the Hawaiian world is separated into. The top level was \u2018above\u2019 or the heavens where there was information on important people in Hawaii\u2019s history. The middle level was \u2018outward\u2019 or the horizon and beyond, where there was a lot of information on culture. And the bottom level was \u2019below\u2019 or the depth of the sea, where there was information on boats, fishing, and the significance of the ocean. The group went around and said some connections we made to previous learnings we have had throughout the trip. There was a lot of information on outrigger canoes; exhibits on the different types, how they are made, what they were used for and much more. It was fun to learn more about the canoes after getting to paddle in one. There was a lot of information on kapa cloth, a fabric made from the bark of a wauke or paper mulberry plant. The cloth is made from pounding the wet bark to thin it; when it is the desired length it is painted on and can be used for almost anything, such as clothing, shoes, blankets, decorations, and packaging. We met a woman making this on our hike in Waimea Valley. There were also lots of things that we could connect to the different books we were reading, like all of the information on Moloka\u2019i and the leprosy outbreak in Hawaii. Next we talked about what we learned. We all found different aspects interesting and took time to immerse ourselves in them. There was a whole section devoted to tattoos, or tatau. The walls were lined with pictures of beautiful and intricate tattoos. Samoan tattoos are one of the world&#8217;s most distinctive tattoo trends, and have been essential in the preservation of the Samoan culture. Being a tofuga (master tattoo artist) was a high social status. Tattoos were tied to coming of age and the government, and getting one was part of a big ritual. One part of the museum I found interesting was the part talking about medicine. Hawaiian medicine was applied 5 times because the body has 5 members: the head, chest, stomach, hips and legs. The moon phases were also super important to the Hawaiin culture. The different phases told people when planting, fishing and weather would be good. We all went around to talk about our questions that we had during our exploration through the Hawaiian Hall. There were a lot of questions about the gods: what determines a god&#8217;s gender? How many are there? What are all the gods&#8217; powers? Overall we all loved the Hawaiian Hall and walked away with a lot of new, interesting information to keep our minds occupied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We transitioned our discussion towards our assigned reading. The final project of the class will be a paper, connecting the aforementioned reading to the trip, as well as the few days of class prior. The precise goal of this \u201cBook Talk&#8221;\u2014as it came to be known\u2014was to define a specific question for this paper to answer.&nbsp; While each question was specific to each person, there was an overarching theme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People wanted to bring everything together. All the learning experiences, facts, and understandings wanted to coalesce into a single question. A single understanding constructed from the connections between these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the exhaustive discussions concluded, we all looked towards the hotels of Honolulu. Massive pillars of cement and marble, they encircled the tourist epicenter of Hawaii: Waikiki. Brushing off the lethargy that usually results from extended discussions, the group fractured into smaller pods and set out to the Waikiki shopping district. As Chelsea made clear earlier that morning, the intent was to see what many envision when they hear the word \u201cHawaii\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last two weeks, we experienced a diverse set of people, places, plants, and animals that now make up our vision of Oahu. As primarily a tourist destination, most people who visit the Hawaiian Islands don\u2019t understand how scarce native plant life is. Nor do they see the native Hawaiian people\u2019s unique, ongoing effort to maintain and replenish their culture. Many tourists never leave Honolulu, let alone work and camp on a community farm. We had a chance to see Hawaii as it truly is: a home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to look down upon the tourist industry with pity or scorn. It is true that most tourists don\u2019t experience what life in Hawaii really is, but that is also not their goal. They want a chance to relax, perhaps even reflect on life. To say that these vacationers do not give back would be pretentious. The island\u2019s entire economy rests on its primary export: tourism. Even in the breadth and depth of this trip, we did not learn much about the relationship between the Hawaiian people and the Hawaiian corporation. It is dangerous to put judgment on that which we don\u2019t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This afternoon in Waikiki was a glimpse into that unknown. In this writer\u2019s opinion, it was pretty underwhelming. The Waikiki strip felt like every other mall in America. That may be intentional. The industry might just be responding to their consumers desire to feel comfortable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We reunited the pods in the same place they fractured: the Hilton Hotel beach side lawn, where we were greeted by Chelsea&#8217;s former student, Logan Shiroma. The exchange was brief, giving an overview of each other\u2019s lives. She gifted us some candy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking to the van, the group waved one last farewell to those quarantined. Then we unceremoniously climbed inside and drove the short distance to the airport. After silently thanking the island and its inhabitants for their hospitality, we boarded a plane and flew home.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Waking up at 7:30, we made ourselves a delicious breakfast of eggs and pancakes.
