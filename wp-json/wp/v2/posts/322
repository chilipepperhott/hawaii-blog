Keira had mentioned a sore throat earlier that evening, so she and Becky decided to test out of an abundance of caution. Before she had gotten halfway back to the tents, Becky caught up to her and gently broke the news She has Covid. Definitely not the news anyone wants to hear, especially with fun events and a long flight scheduled for the next few days. As bummed out and concerned as she was, Keira was ready to go with the flow and stay positive about the situation. She was also proud to have made it this long, as this is the first time she\u2019s gotten Covid! Plus, this was way better than getting sick right at the beginning of the trip. Upon arrival back to the kitchen, Becky got a similar taste of information. Chelsea read the positive result out to her, too. At least they weren\u2019t alone, right?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liliana was summoned next, as they\u2019ve been Keira\u2019s tent mate for the duration of the trip, and the group would need to know how sleeping arrangements would be shifted around. With their test coming out negative, the decision was made to also test Jenna and Raina. Raina\u2019s came back with a faint line indicating a positive result, so we decided to separate the four of us for the night. We would wait until morning to break the news and test everyone else.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a morning of solemnly moping around, everyone in KN95 masks, coping in their own ways, Keira, Raina, and Becky were on their way to the airport to take a rapid PCR test. Chelsea and Becky had spent too much time trying to find a testing site, and the closest with a rapid result was the airport. The drive was sad, quiet, and extremely long. We spent 20 minutes driving around the airport to find the right parking place, and after not being able to, we decided to park as close as possible (which was unnecessarily far away) and walk. After finally getting there, we struggled to properly register for the tests. Keira and Raina sat on the curb while Becky sorted things out. Eventually, we were able to get through our tests and make the trek back to the car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally free from airport purgatory, we set off in search of a belated lunch. Google Maps led us to a nonexistent Wendy\u2019s, so with growling stomachs and a static-heavy radio, we roamed the streets in search of another option. As if by a miracle, Keira spotted a Panda Express out of the corner of her eye and we circled the block to approach the drive-thru. We had no idea Panda Express even had drive-thrus!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food acquired at last, we returned to one of our first beaches for a socially-distanced picnic. Once we finished eating, we were able to talk to our parents on the phone, which was fun despite the circumstances! As we waited for the AirBnB to be ready, Raina worked intently on another friendship bracelet and Keira dug a sandcastle barricade to protect her seat from the rising tide. We spent some nice time walking with our feet in the water as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After our journey to the beach, we headed to the AirBnB to settle in. We met up with Julie, as she flew in after a call saying that Chelsea needed extra assistance since Becky would be out. She took the car and headed to the Vrbo to meet up with the rest of the group.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rest time was still not quite upon us as we fought with the technology in the AirBnB with the last remaining braincell we shared. The instacart order for dinner wouldn\u2019t be arriving in time, so we decided to order pizza. The online system was malfunctioning and the store hung up on Becky three times. All while she was dealing with this, Keira was trying to get the smart tv\/Blu-ray box to work. After switching batteries between remotes, unplugging things, and eventually stealing the (superior) monitor from Becky\u2019s bedroom, it was up and running. Connecting to the Wi-Fi went smoothly, but then Raina and Keira both proceeded to forget their Netflix passwords for the next ten minutes. We were too tired for a movie anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we finally got our pizza, (we landed on each of us getting our own small individual ones) Becky unexpectedly headed outside onto the balcony. We had been awaiting the call all day to determine our test results. When Becky came inside, she looked at Raina with her pizza box in her hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t eat that in here.\u201d Raina, confused, said \u201cumm, why not?\u201d as to which Becky responded with \u201cBecause you\u2019re not staying here.\u201d After a couple seconds of watching the gears turning in Raina\u2019s head, she finally shouted out and starting jumping up and down, when Becky and Keira also joined her in the chaotic craziness of the feeling Raina had of being able to go home. Keira and Becky\u2019s tests came back positive unfortunately, but they couldn\u2019t help but feel happy for Raina. We all split ways and sat on different balconies to enjoy our pizza while we awaited Julie to come pick Raina up to join the rest of the group.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Raina was off to reunite with everyone else, Becky and Keira settled in further for the night. It was very quiet without the rest of the group, but it was also nice to have some peace and privacy, not to mention the incredible ocean view. Keira slept for fourteen hours, but Becky was back up with the sunrise for her teacherly duties. Thanks Becky!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spent the rest of our time in Waikiki working, relaxing, talking to the many birds that visited our balcony, and enjoying a wave goodbye to the rest of the group before they flew out. Thanks to the goodies they brought us, as well as the ridiculous amount of snacks Becky\u2019s aunt Deborah dropped off, we were very well fed and felt loved! We painted our nails multiple times, had a mini spa day, watched all of <em>Good Omens<\/em>, completed a jigsaw puzzle, and eventually got to go swimming in the ocean one last time before beginning the long flight back home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This story really starts at about 9:30 last night, with Chelsea, Becky, and Keira taking some home Covid tests.
