One side: we got to sleep in past the planned wake-up call at 6:30. Subsequent the day of outrigger canoeing, we were dead tired, and so the extra sleep was appreciated. The other side of the story: some members of our group contracted the dreaded SARS-CoV-2.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original plan for the day involved a visit to the Bishop Museum. As Chelsea relayed the news of the virus\u2019 invasion, one could feel the apprehension and uncertainty ripple through the group. As the new plan was being worked out, everyone became beautifully adorned with the (sadly familiar) KN95 masks. From then on, every action had to be executed with utmost care, for if one became infected, they would be trapped for 5 days in a hotel room, thousands of miles away from home, dead center of the Pacific Ocean. After breakfast had been consumed, as well as a short wait for the rain to stop, the group scattered about. Some read their books, some wandered into the woods to abuse bamboo, and some played solo chess (which, for reference, Joshua lost).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After refreshing with some Shave Ice from a place called Waiola, we began our journey to our Vrbo stationed in Kaimuki, Honolulu. At this point, the energy of the group settled as we began to reflect on the situation, the missed opportunities, our lost group members, and what would happen next. Our mental reflections would be cut off short though, as we arrived at the Vrbo and had trouble parking for 5 solid minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-257\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>The uninfected crew enjoying a beautiful view on the drive to the Airbnb.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth noting that Hawaii is not unique with the wonderful treat Shave Ice (though that does not invalidate its goodness). For example, Bao Bing, sold in China, is practically the same thing. It was first introduced to Hawaii by Japanese immigrants in the mid-1800s as <em>kakigori<\/em>. Skipping over a century, we arrive in the mid-1900s, when some Hawaiian families opened up general stores and began selling the product, calling it shave ice (though at some places on Hawaii the island, it is called ice shave). One such example of a general store is Matsumoto\u2019s, opened in 1951, which does business to this very day (and, if I may add, quite successfully; they easily reach 1,000 sales of shave ice alone on an average weekend Honolulu day.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearily, we entered the Vrbo, astonished by the quality of the place. While not the view we got to experience from the top of the penthouse on days 1 and 2, we had an unparalleled living experience, actual showers, and had enough beds for everyone (with Joshua graciously taking a large closet).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Informing Watershed was one of the first things Becky and Chelsea did after learning of the COVID cases. The direct result: Julie Yates immediately hopped on a plane and began the seven hour flight from Denver to Honolulu. Shortly after the group arrived at our Vrbo rental, Julie landed and drove the distance to join us. Greeted with smiling faces hidden behind masks, some of us could finally feel much of the remaining apprehension and anxiety vanishing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As our trip to the Bishop museum was postponed and our plans had vanished, we decided to watch Despicable Me, absolutely demolish a bag of Chex Mix, work on this very blog, and generally reflect on the terrible day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still drenched with sadness (and some of us with rain,) over our now lost group members, we absolutely inhaled chicken fajitas. But at least something went right, because our sorrow was somewhat cut short when Chelsea announced that while Raina tested positive when she had done the rapid test while back at camp, she had taken a PCR test at the hotel and came back negative. We were rejuvenated, finally having gotten good news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After we finished dinner, we started to set up our beds for the coming night. Our preparations, like many other things, had been cut short; Raina had finally arrived. We cheered, and some greeted with open arm hugs (whether we should\u2019ve been hugging after having such an intense COVID scare is up to debate). At this point, we had our traditional circle, and could finally get to bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Heyo. Ari here. Today was \u2014with more certainty than I thought possible\u2014 a true test of character. As Chelsea so succinctly put it: \u201cIt\u2019s strange seeing so many people processing the same thing together in the same place.\u201d And so, in our individual processing, we all went separate ways; some crying, some sitting solemnly in the rain, some laughing in order to forget. And then there was me, rampaging in the forest by beating down trees with a sturdy bamboo stick. I thought I had learned, over these past couple of years, to control my emotions. Turns out they were learning too. They won me over, and taught me a lesson in the process. They taught me that no matter how much I try not to be, I am human. They taught me that I can scream and cry and smile and die and that that\u2019s all okay. That I am alive, and that that\u2019s the reason I can feel. That I, in all, am human. And I, in all, am proud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that\u2019s not a Watershed moment, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks, COVID.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>In the months prior to our departure to Hawai\u2019i, that funny feeling had started to fade.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That funny feeling that the world was out of control. Permanently unstable. Permanently uncertain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That funny feeling that the temporal landmarks our parents previously defended as sacred, were no&nbsp; longer as important. Prom, graduation, parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That funny feeling that we had no say. Not even the leaders of the most powerful institutions seemed to be able to quell the storm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That funny feeling that people had begun to go missing. Lost to history among a crowd of millions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If heaven exists, the immigration office must be freaking out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, that funny feeling returned. Not just for one person; for all of us. Chelsea&#8217;s line on collective processing reminded us of that. The pandemic has been terrible on every scale, but it has done something not many things have: created common ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the hours of stories and droplets of wisdom Mark conveyed to us during our stay on Coconut Island, one nuggets stands out. He told us to stop anthropomorphizing things. Calling a pufferfish cute is fun, but it blinds you to its true nature: a poisonous predator that can kill you if you venture too close.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark had a point. But I think there is utility in anthropomorphic projection. For the duration of the pandemic, humanity had a common enemy. Every individual worked to defeat it. Even the pundits and the misinformed who blamed Bill Gates, Chinese Americans, or some fictional cult. Each and every person sought to\u2014even in the most minute way\u2014help defeat the enemy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today was a reminder of that. We all learnt of the infections. We all worked to stop the spread. No one did it the same way, but we all did it.&nbsp;<br>If I have learnt anything from the global pandemic that continues to ravage our lives, it is this: it is humanity\u2019s job to fix humanity\u2019s problems, and <strong>everyone<\/strong> is doing their part.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are two sides to today\u2019s story.
