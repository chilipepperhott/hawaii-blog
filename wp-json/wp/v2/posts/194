Mimicking a regular Watershed school day, we started work time at 8:15. We had some time to read and annotate our books before circling up to discuss them with each other. We talked about how each of our readings related to our guiding concepts of cultural and ecological connection, kuleana, and the impact outsiders have on the islands. We recognized recurring themes of connection to place, the negative impacts of colonization, and the importance of sharing knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To continue our conversation, we circled up at Kailua Beach to briefly talk about what \u2018kuleana\u2019 means to us. Despite the lack of an exact English translation of kuleana, we have managed to describe it as follows: it is a reciprocal relationship with, and an obligation to, another party\u2014often the land, your community, or self. The participation is not simply for obligation\u2019s sake, but because of an understanding and desire to be responsible because you care about what you\u2019re doing and the impact it has. We shared thoughts about our own kuleana in daily life. Students gave examples such as keeping bees and maintaining the mountain biking trails we love, exemplifying the theme of reciprocal connections with nature. Other themes that emerged were taking care of family and friends, as well as extending that same kindness and respect to strangers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a tour of Le Jardin Academy\u2019s (LJA) campus, we walked to Ka`hanaiki; historically an important fish pond that is now marshland. Hawai`i\u2019s parks and wildlife system has designated different portions of the land for different volunteer organizations to maintain. LJA\u2019s Wild Kids are working with Malia, an enthusiastic and knowledgeable woman who works for the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). They aim to restore their space by removing invasive species and planting native plants in their place. Their effort includes food-producing plants, traditional lei-making gardens, and spaces for outdoor education. We worked by digging up Guinea Grass (sometimes referred to as California Grass, despite not originating from California), cutting down trees, and leveling stairs of earth to make an amphitheater designed by a group in LJA\u2019s freshman design class who are hoping to create an outdoor classroom there.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What really spoke to the two of us was the abundance of medicinal and food-producing plants being planted in the forest space. Hawai`i used to be entirely self-sustaining, but now around 92% of all goods are imported. It was inspiring to see the first steps back towards traditional plant use and self-sufficiency in small communities. Food gardening is an empowering and gently radical step toward independence and sustainability, as well as reviving strong cultural practices here in Hawai`i.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malia hung out with us and answered our enthusiastic questions until after our scheduled time. She is so passionate about the work she does and was so willing to share it with us and talk to us about the rich history and biodiversity of the land. To rinse off the dirt and sweat, we headed back to Kailua Beach Park to take a quick dip in the gorgeous and mild ocean before showering. We left the beach with one more classmate, having rescued a stuffed bunny who had been left buried in the sand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We returned to camp, greeted by the lovely smell of the burgers Chelsea was grilling for us. We were shortly joined by Chelsea\u2019s friend Kari who works for a coconut tree trimming company. She brought us all fresh coconuts* that we watched her expertly whack open with a machete. It was a very fun way to end the day!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Beginners\u2019 Guide to Coconutting:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a variety of ways one can climb a coconut tree. Kari and her coconut friends use straps with stirrups that utilize physics to shimmy up the trees. Do not shake the trees, as the coconuts will fall on your head. It\u2019s also not a very reliable way to access them, as they may also not fall at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they grow, the exterior shells of coconuts are green. This does not mean that they are not ready. However, sometimes it does. Do not judge a coconut by its outside. You must steal it from its home and whack it open with a machete. This is also good advice for making friends. Anyways, coconuts. The youngest coconuts have the most water and the least meat. Actually, no coconuts have meat. They\u2019re plants. As they grow older, the water is absorbed into the plant to grow more meat. Over time, the internal shell turns from a light sandy color to the dark brown husk of coconut iconography \ud83e\udd65<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kari opened ours for us by making diagonal incisions in the external husk to reveal the top of the inner shell. She also cut the bottom off to make it flat so we could set them down without spilling. The drinking hole was a small cut across the top about the size of a quarter. Once we finished our drinks, she split each nut open for us to carve out the white meat. Thanks Kari!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img
