While it definitely did not go into the level of detail of an actual college class, there were a few key insights we wouldn\u2019t have connected otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most rocks that form as a result of volcanic activity fall under the category of <strong>basaltic. <\/strong>These rocks cool from lava quickly, so the molecules in the fluid don\u2019t have time to form large crystals. Instead they form an uncountable number of small crystals, invisible to the naked eye. These rocks are extremely tough<strong>\u2014<\/strong>the name basalt comes from the latin word \u201c<em>basanites\u201d, <\/em>which literally translates to \u201cvery hard stone\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We received a basic overview of the processes from far below the surface to the effects left on the earth years after. We learned of the types of rocks that different compounds of lava form, as well as the most dangerous types of explosions. Volcanic tsunamis and pyroclastic flows coming in at numbers 1 and 2. Much of the danger of volcanoes comes from gasses and acid released before and long after explosions. There are many different types of volcanoes and eruptions, including shield volcanoes<strong>\u2014<\/strong>very wide mountains looking somewhat similar to upside down roman shields, Pahoehoe\u2014ropey or floppy formations created by the different viscosities of lava flows, A\u2019a\u2014very slow and containing large rocks, lava tubes\u2014a tunnel created just beneath the surface to reach a destination rather that traveling above ground, and fissure eruptions\u2014a chasm created in the earth from which the lava escapes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;All the Hawaiian islands formed from a single hot spot, with separate volcanoes erupting millions of years apart. Coming from the earth&#8217;s core, a long stream of magma \u201cbubbles\u201d slowly accumulates in earth\u2019s crust. Over the course of millions of years, the accumulated magma climaxes in an explosive eruption. Because of the mobile nature of Hawaii\u2019s tectonic plates, this eruption creates a new island.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For many people, one of the first words that comes to mind when they hear the word \u201cHawaii\u201d is volcano.&nbsp; To get a better understanding of how volcanoes form and can affect life in nearby areas, our class traveled to the Colorado School of Mines, where we received a lecture from one Dr. Christian Shorey. &hellip; <\/p>\n<p class=\"link-more\"><a href=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/2022\/05\/03\/pre-trip-geology-school-of-mines\/\" class=\"more-link\">Read more<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> &#8220;Pre-trip: Geology &#038; School of Mines&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":12,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/12"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":115,"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93\/revisions\/115"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
