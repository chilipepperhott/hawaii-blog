We used the time for general relaxation, running, reading, strolling, whatever. We were also able to get a better view of the Chinaman\u2019s Hat Island, which we had heard of from Aunt Deborah. We had a short lesson about how Chinamans hat was once part of the actual island, although due to coastal erosion it is no longer connected. Additionally, we learned that the whole of Kaneohe bay is a major breeding ground for hammerhead and tiger sharks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0032-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-177\" width=\"332\" height=\"249\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0032-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0032-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0032-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0032-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0032-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0032-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Chelsea was able to catch back up with us, we went to Waimea valley, and began an informative walk, with the end destination being a large waterfall in the heart of a watershed.\u00a0 We were able to learn tons of information about the culture of a small native Hawaiian village as well as all the ways that plants and animals are able to play a role in the lives of all the citizens. We heard a lot about how the native Polynesians follow general conservancy \u201cpolicy.\u201d Whenever they would catch a bird, either through tar traps, or some other method, they would make absolutely sure to use every piece of the bird. They would use the feathers for leis, and every other part else for whatever they most needed at that time. In my opinion, one of the most interesting things we learned was how the Polynesians once used a system of tunnels and caves to raise pigs and dogs to be eaten. As a group, we probably spent a solid hour talking with some of the Hawaiian natives, learning a lot about the tools and materials, such as a lava rock mullet used to crush tarot root into poi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-3 wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2919-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-180\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2919-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2919-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2919-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2919-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2919-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2919-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0090-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-178\" width=\"228\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0090-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0090-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0090-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0090-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0090-2000x2667.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0090-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the hike, our group was beginning to become VERY hangry. Luckily, there was a nearby grocery store where we bought poke bowls. After our group was set, we drove over to a nearby beach to eat and jump off a popular rock into the ocean. While we were swimming, we found a sea turtle on the rock next to us. Unfortunately, it quickly swam off, startled by our unnatural presence. Strangely enough, it takes time to adapt to the flora and fauna of a new environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0151-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-179\" width=\"378\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0151-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0151-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0151-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0151-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0151-2000x2667.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_0151-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After forcing Becky and Chelsy to drag us out of the ocean, we drove over to meet a group of high school students attending Le Jardian, a local school. We arrived at a plot of land they were beginning to turn into a self-sufficient farm. It was truly amazing to see kids our age engaging in efforts to give back to the land. When we stepped out of the van, we were greeted by an enthusiastic group of high school students. We intermingled and quickly started conversations, gathering local insight on University of Hawaii, farm ecology, and history of the land, such as the creation of calderas across the archipelago. After a few hours, our groups parted and we began to prepare for the evening. We set up our tents in a nearby area and took in the incomprehensible beauty of the Ko\u2019olau mountain range. Afterwards, we had a simple dinner and prepared for another day in Hawaiian paradise.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2938-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-181\" width=\"401\" height=\"301\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2938-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2938-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2938-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2938-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2938-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_2938-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Once again, we awoke to the magnificent view of the sprawling city beneath us.
