Instead, due to yesterday&#8217;s COVID events, we did Monday&#8217;s plan; the Bishop Museum.<br><br>We woke up at 7:30 in the morning to Ari and Zac playing an intense chess match, and cereal waiting for us. After we had our breakfast and got dressed for the day (with a packing list created by Chelsea) we left at around 8:45 to head to the Bishop Museum. Upon arrival, we immediately noticed the beauty of the campus. It looked like an Ivy League college campus, with evenly spread out vegetation and perfectly green grass covering every possible inch.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal for our visit was to go to the Hawaiian hall and the Science Adventure Center. Both of which are absolutely massive and absolutely filled with information. The science hall being filled with tons of information on the formation of the Hawaiian islands and volcanic flows, and the Hawaiian hall being filled with cultural history. After going through both of the sections of the museum we went to see a planetarium show on the Wayfinder, a ship that sailed between many Pacific island chains, including Hawaii and Tahiti. Upon finishing the short movie, the planetarium staff member did a small presentation for us on how to navigate the ocean using only the sun, stars, and our hands. Obviously, there was a ton of information that we would be missing, as it takes years for someone to even be able to start navigating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After we finished our visit to the museum, we readily headed into the van for our 15 minute ride to the beach. With the temperature being in the low eighties, it was both sad and amazing for us to get into the water. Sad, because it was our final ocean time, and amazing because of how great it felt. We had an amazing final beach hour, small calm waves, no current, a nearby coral reef and warm waters. Many of us swam over to the reef, which was just a foot or two below the surface of the water, and we spent most of our time over there, splashing each other and diving. About halfway through, a few people swam to the shore to either chill out, or dig holes (a previously mentioned favorite pastime of our beach visits).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we finished our time in the sand, we took about 10 minutes to do a quick get-the-saltwater-off beach shower and make a change of clothes. From there we traveled to the Vrbo, where we split off into groups, some people reading their choice books and some people cleaning out the group van. We also did our full shower rotation. At around 5:30, we transitioned into blog work and preparing for dinner. We watched the Disney \u2018film\u2019 <em>Moana <\/em>to finish our final full day in Hawaii, all of us excited to finally head home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this being our final full day in Hawaii, we feel like we did a lot of the highlights. We learned about Hawaiian culture and history at the Bishop Museum, and we spent time in the water and the sand, with the sun beating down on us. We can\u2019t wait to be back, either together or separately in the future!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One realization we had at the Bishop Museum was that where we were, the island of O\u2019ahu, developed much the same as other islands (culturally, at least, and until the arrival of the rest of the world\u2019s peoples.) This was inspired by a boating evolution exhibit, which showed one of the original (potentially Tahitian) double-hulled canoes used to travel around the Polynesian Triangle of ye olde Pacific. But while cultures branched throughout time and throughout the islands, the double-hull design and purpose remained the same, save for a few widenings, narrowings, and visually evident fabrication techniques.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the efforts the Polynesians made into making their vessels was their efforts they made into making a reliable system for navigating the ocean. And we\u2019re glad they did&#8211; if the rest of the world got to Hawai\u2019i first, there would be no ancient history to study (or, in other words, not quite enough to make a course out of).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4-scaled-e1653321217902-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-259\" width=\"451\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4-scaled-e1653321217902-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4-scaled-e1653321217902-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4-scaled-e1653321217902-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4-scaled-e1653321217902-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4-scaled-e1653321217902.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" \/><figcaption>Walking through the blacklight hallway detailing Hawaiian natural history<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/35-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"389\"\/><figcaption>Taking in paintings of Hawaiian people&#8217;s history<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/5-scaled-e1653321237213-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-260\" width=\"-233\" height=\"-310\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/5-scaled-e1653321237213-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/5-scaled-e1653321237213-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/5-scaled-e1653321237213-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/5-scaled-e1653321237213-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/5-scaled-e1653321237213.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption>Demoing surfing while learning about reef protection<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Initially, our plan for the day was to go to the Paepae o He&#8217;eia fish pond to do some work restoring it to its natural setting.
