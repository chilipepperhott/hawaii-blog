We arrived at eight at the Hui Nalu Halau for a morning of outrigger canoeing. We got a quick lesson about the difference between more modern canoes versus more traditional canoes made out of koa wood. The traditionally crafted canoes take over two years to build, and that\u2019s after the 50 years that it takes for the tree to grow. Due to the labor and skill necessary to craft such a vessel, these canoes can cost in the neighborhood one hundred thousand dollars. We used our combined might to get the over 400-lb boats into the water, at which point we loaded up into two separate double-hull canoes and paddled away.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the lead of a few of the club members and teachers, including but not limited to Jeff, KT, and Liz, we learned how to properly hold the paddles and synchronize our strokes. Every twelve strokes, the person in the chair closest to the bow (known as \u201cfirst chair\u201d), yells \u201chut\u201d. While one takes their last stroke, you acknowledge with \u201choe\u201d and switch sides. We paddled around Maunalua Bay, learning tidbits of history and nautical navigation and feeling the swells rise and fall beneath us. A mutiny of splashing took place which resulted in inter- and intra-boat warfare. Soaked, we paddled back to shore. We were greeted with malasadas, which are fluffy balls of sugary heaven, and Anne Marie, a story-catcher of the Hawaiian history of Maunalua Bay. Anne Marie shared the stories and the history of the area, and it was clear to see the impact of the development of the area. In fact, we were sitting on man-made ground and it was hard to imagine how such a now-populated area could have once been a prosperous fish pond that opened up to the ocean. What we learned from this conversation was yet another demonstration between western expansion and the perseverance of native Hawaiian culture.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then went back and relaxed at the farm for a few hours. This was a much needed recuperation time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some down time, we were on our way to reunite with the entire Risch family, this time also including Chelsea\u2019s partner, who was on island for work. Mike and Graham Risch are both associated with the Air Force and were able to host us on Bellows Air Force Station. Maile taught us how to cook luau, letting us participate in the process. Lu\u2019au is a traditional Hawaiian delicacy made of Kalo leaves, coconut milk, vegetable broth, purple sweet potatoes, carrots and onions, all served over rice. We each used this time to foster our individual needs, either by swimming, journaling, chatting, or helping in the kitchen. We ended the evening watching the lunar eclipse and sending a group selfie to the Iceland crew.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we got new insight into the culture that we have been hearing about and experiencing for the past 12 days. At this point in the trip, we feel a sense of ohana, or family, amongst ourselves and it was nice to reconnect with another family. Hawaii is often called the melting pot of many different cultures. These last two weekends barbecuing with the Risch family have been a chance to experience that in a cross between American and Hawaiian cultures. The smoky scent of the grill combined with the lovely aroma of the lu\u2019au reminded us of this fact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" data-id=\"278\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/31-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-278\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/31-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/31-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/31-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/31-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/31-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/31-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/31-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" data-id=\"281\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/34-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/34-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/34-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/34-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/34-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/34-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/34-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/34-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" data-id=\"277\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/30-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-277\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/30-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/30-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/30-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/30-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/30-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/30-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/30-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><figcaption>Group<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" data-id=\"276\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/29-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/29-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/29-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/29-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/29-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/29-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/29-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/29-2000x1500.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><figcaption>Whole group can<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We started our day with a fast wakeup and our usual Special K breakfast.
