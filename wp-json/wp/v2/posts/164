Last night was our first night at Le Jardin\u2019s community farm where we spent time working on this morning. Some of the students joined us early and we were assigned a variety of jobs. We built a new area for their chickens, removed invasive California Grass and other weeds, and moved rocks to create a wall for plant terraces. This service work helped us get a deeper understanding of our guiding questions, as we worked to help maintain and revive Hawaiian bioculture.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our favorite snacks while working on the farm for the morning was lychee fruits. Lychee is a non-native plant that was brought over with the Polynesians who first came to Hawai\u2019i. There is a big lychee tree on the property right near where we were working, so we spent time as a group climbing up the tree limbs and picking the bright red fruit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one of our guiding questions asks how humans and ecological communities are connected, and working with the students and eating the lychee fruit really made it clear how intertwined they are, and how two completely different groups could bond over the simple act of picking fruit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For lunch, the Wild Kids and organizers brought lots of delish food and grilled burgers for a great potluck. We spent time as a big group sharing stories and laughs. We learned about their school plays, prom, and their hopes and future dreams. Following lunch and the departure of the Wild Kids, we took a trip down to Sherwoods Beach, a quick little scenic drive from the farm. We spent a short while playing in the waves and getting salty before taking outdoor beach showers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a fast turnaround and picked up one of the lovely Wild Kids, Arwen, a sophomore at Le Jardin Academy, the Wild Kids Activism Team Lead, and the Wild Kids social media manager. (Along with that long title, she\u2019s just a lovely lad*.) Then all 13 of us drove 30ish minutes away to go see the Wild and Scenic Film Festival, an annual national film festival that helps inspire young activists. The whole production lasted roughly four hours, with live music to start us off along with delicious food. We talked with Arwen and Sienna, the two Wild Kids who joined us for the film festival, and all enjoyed the amazing short films. One of the groups favorite films was If You Give A Beach A Bottle, a film about a painter who got invited on a beach clean up in Alaska, and painted the polluted scenes that he saw. The film ended with him painting the view of all the other people that were helping with the clean up, a contrast to the images he was painting before, giving us a clear view on a hopeful future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After we parted ways with Arwen and Sienna for the night, we all quickly hustled into the van, had a short argument on if we wanted the AC on or off, and headed back to the farm. Within 5 minutes of departing, the majority of us had fallen asleep.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got back, all half asleep, had a quick little wrap up circle, and fell asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillow (or crumpled lump of shirts.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*lad. n. a swaggy person&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images
