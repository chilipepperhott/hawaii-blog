We learned many new and exciting things that properly set up the rest of the course in visiting the burn site next to NCAR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing we had a lesson on was Landscape Ecology, the study of interactions between spatial patterns and ecological processes on all scales. A subset of this field of study is the concept of disturbance regimes. One example of this is the periodic fires on Colorado\u2019s foothills. Using that as an example, we can determine that on the foothills, the quantity of plant and animal life follows a roughly sinusoidal curve, growing and being destroyed repeatedly over time. This is a disturbance regime: A phenomenon that periodically changes an ecosystem, not remaining in effect for long enough before each time for the ecosystem to bounce back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melinda, a friend of Becky&#8217;s from grad school, came up to greet us at the top of the \u201cant hill\u201d right next to NCAR during that same visit. Melinda has been a park ranger of the area for the past 5 years, and is very knowledgeable on the subject of landscape ecology. With her working in the exact area where the NCAR fire started, and knew part of the timeline of what happened. Using the NCAR fire as an example she described a lot of the processes of fighting fires. One of the things she focused on was how fighting wildfires has evolved over the past few years, and how climate change has made the fire season be year round. Within the past few years we have become way more prepared for wildfires. Melinda described the time between the first report and the arrival of firefighters to be just around 5 minutes. With all of her knowledge about the area, she set up a nice amount of information for our studies in Hawaii.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the base of the \u201cant hill\u201d, as we called it, we did a small study around the difference in amount of grasses in the burned area, and the unburned area. To decide the area we were going to collect our data from we threw a flag randomly into the air and wherever it landed we collected our data within 20 centimeters around it. With the data we collected we discovered that the amount of grasses in the unburned area was higher, but they were all dead, and there were less grasses in the burned area, but they were much fresher and greener. This data was consistent with everyone, with us all getting around the same amount of grass blades in the 20&#215;20 area.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our first day of May Term 2022 was a good starter to our course.
