Since we will be spending 15 days with each other, we have to learn how to work together and be together. We spent some time before our swim test reflecting on the leadership rubric and which parts were most important for us personally. We then talked as a group about how to act on those and examples of how we can portray a leader and good member of the group. Some of the topics we covered are how we can come out of our main friend groups and interact more with the rest of the group. We talked about how we can go out of our comfort zones in this new environment and interact with locals and the people we meet. We also spoke of how going somewhere where there&#8217;s a lot of tourism it is crucial we really immerse ourselves in Hawaiian culture and interact with local people to get the most from the trip.&nbsp; On Watershed trips it is super important we have an open mind, are ok with being uncomfortable, take care of ourselves while taking care of each other, and are aware and in control of our behavior and actions. We also sat around in one of our closing circles and talked about our own personal needs and struggles that we could help support one another with. Here are the norms we came up with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Know how to be with each other<\/li><li>Be humble<\/li><li>Go with the flow<\/li><li>Look for the fun and interesting aspects of the trip+engage<\/li><li>Be aware of your needs and communicate them<\/li><li>Make the most of it<\/li><li>Trust yourself and the group<\/li><li>Check-in with yourself and others<\/li><li>Take care of yourself mentally and physically<\/li><li>Posture checks<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve had a couple of moments to really start the conversation about group norms and the dynamic between us.
