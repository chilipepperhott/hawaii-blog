Starting the day bright and early, we went to the school and began with a class on the native Hawaiian language. Just before we entered, we stood in the hall as the girls conducted a native Hawaiian chant of welcoming. Once inside, we spoke to the freshman girls and bonded with them over our favorite places. We learned the vocabulary associated with the Hawaiian Honeycreeper, a native class of birds. Some of the words like eyes (maka), beak (nuku), wing (\u2018\u0113heu), feather (hulu), and claws (m\u0101i\u2019u\u2019u) have hula dance moves that we practiced. Next, we joined an 11th grade biology class to learn more about the Honeycreeper. We played a card game that the students made, making use of card \u201ctrees\u201d to represent parts of the different Hawaiian ecosystems. While playing the game, we had conversations about the differences between Hawaiian&nbsp; ecosystems and our own. We concluded our time at Sacred Hearts with pizza with the senior girls in the spacious cafe area at the school. We discussed surfing, snowsports, other extracurricular activities, and food.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterward we left the Academy and went to the beach to hang out and debrief. We spoke about difficult or surprising interactions, memorable moments, and attempted to sum up the experience in 10 words\u2014 no more, no less. We discovered that as we met with older and older students throughout the day, the conversations tended to flow better. What we failed to consider was that we, too, were becoming more amiable through time as we got used to the place and the people. One common topic of discussion was how Hawaii has a lot of unique food that you can\u2019t get anywhere else. We found that even though we don\u2019t live the same lives or even in the same places, we found similarity in the private school bubbles we live in, and in how, when that bubble pops, our eyes are opened to a broader world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then paid a visit to the University of Hawaii, where we spoke to two researchers, Derek Risch &amp; Kalei Stormcrow, about research methods and potential preservation efforts. We got to understand some of the connections between animals, plants, and the people on the islands in the past and the present. In particular, we learned about the effects of invasive species such as the wild boar and that they dig up forest soil on a regular basis, disallowing any plants from taking root. We also heard about the Pueo (Hawaiian short-eared owl) and how their population is being affected by climate change and invasive species. We also discovered that Pueo birds have a lot of cultural value throughout Hawaii; For example, ancestors can manifest in a Pueo and help their families. This furthered our understanding of how native animals and native Hawaiians are interconnected.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finishing up our day, we had a blast at the beach in Waikiki, finally being able to fully submerge ourselves as we swam in the shadow of Duke Kahanamoku, a surfer icon, Olympian, and Hawaiian watersports pioneer. Today we began going beyond tourism; immersing ourselves in Hawaiian culture as we learned new things and made new friends.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 words describing our experience at Sacred Hearts Academy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ari: \u201cBouts of blisteringly bright peeps, bridges built when believers meet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liliana: \u201cA silly, fun, educational, smile-inducing time with new friends.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carson: [pause between each word and count them on your fingers] \u201cIt was absolutely fricking awesome and I loved it all.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" data-id=\"161\"  src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20BF8CE8-5103-40C8-875F-56A1B0500FE4-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-161\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20BF8CE8-5103-40C8-875F-56A1B0500FE4-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20BF8CE8-5103-40C8-875F-56A1B0500FE4-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20BF8CE8-5103-40C8-875F-56A1B0500FE4-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20BF8CE8-5103-40C8-875F-56A1B0500FE4-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20BF8CE8-5103-40C8-875F-56A1B0500FE4-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20BF8CE8-5103-40C8-875F-56A1B0500FE4-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/20BF8CE8-5103-40C8-875F-56A1B0500FE4-2000x1500.jpeg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we reflected on the differences between Hawaii and Colorado by talking to the students at Sacred Hearts Academy, a local private catholic school for girls.
