With a great start to the day, we had a wonderful breakfast of bagels with a side of ocean breeze and took off on a tour of the island with our esteemed guide, Mark the marine biologist. As we journeyed around the island, Mark explained more of the history of the island, starting off as the living place of a seaweed collector, then switching hands between the military and millionaire playboys several times. Eventually, the island ended up as a science lab, sponsored by one of the less playboy millionaires. Today, the island is home to a couple private residents, the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, and visiting researchers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/elijahpotter.dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-2000x2667.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/10.0.0.65\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/28-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption>The group picking up sea urchins, coral, and sea cucumbers in the touch pool<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the tour, we gathered at a touch tank full of corals, urchins, and sea cucumbers. We were excited to take part in a bit of childish fun mixed in with useful (and at times random) information from Mark\u2019s seemingly infinite sources of knowledge, varying from the structure of coral to general life advice, ex: How to get an internship in a lab.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We gathered our bags and made our way to the ferry for a short but thoughtful ride back to the mainland of Oahu. Unlike most of our other visits, the connection to culture seemed less apparent at first. However, after a moment of consideration, Mark\u2019s career path as well as his work displays an intense passion for the land and ocean, displaying his Kuleana prominently. He is dedicated to stewarding the ocean to provide a healthy and educational environment for generations to come. Finally, we arrived back at the mainland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a brief loss of the van keys, we finally took off, heading back to the Le Jardin farm and our wonderful chicken friends. After a short ride, we arrived back at the farm and set up our camp, remembering the wonderful moments from our earlier stay at the farm. We enjoyed a moment of rest before gathering our laundry for a much needed wash.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very excited to have another laundry day, we set off for Kailua. We got our clothes loaded up efficiently, minus the many trips to the change machine for quarters. As our clothes spun around, we enjoyed the breeze from the open garage doors and read our books.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterwards, we had an hour to explore Kailua town. Many students got smoothies and shopped for souvenirs and gifts for loved ones back home. One of the shopkeepers was excited to see so many kids from Colorado because she loves the state and used to work there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was interesting to step into the tourist world of tchotchke shops and mass-produced replicas of culturally significant objects. It&#8217;s a stark contrast to the in-depth experience we\u2019ve been having so far. As much as I love walking around and shopping, it felt strange and disappointing to pass by many near-identical storefronts and crowds of visitors for whom this is their primary view of Hawai\u2018i.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we returned to the farm, we took the much cooler weather as an opportunity to do a trash pickup around the house. We were excited to help the Wild Kids crew. We found a handful of old cassette tapes in the dirt that Elijah is going to use for an art project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After quickly filling the trash bag and sufficiently washing our hands, it was time to prepare dinner. We had a Queen sing-along as half of the group cooked and the other worked on blog writing and editing. After a mouth-watering meal of fajitas, we parted ways to enjoy another night in Hawaiian paradise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a great night\u2019s sleep, it was rather wonderful to not wake up to the screeches of chickens.
