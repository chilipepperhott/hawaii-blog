					<description><![CDATA[Hey! I agree, the book has been really engaging and interesting! Thanks so much for that news, I was able to listen to the song last night and it was an absolute jam. Iâ€™m still processing. Thanks for keeping up with the blog! Canâ€™t wait to tell you all about the trip :)]]></description>
